\TYPE {restart : unit -> proof}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the proof state to the initial goal.

\DESCRIBE
The function {restart} is part of the subgoal package. A call to {restart}
clears the proof history and returns to the initial goal. After a call to
{restart}, the proof state is the same as it was after the inital call to
{set_goal} (or {g}). For a description of the subgoal package, see {set_goal}.

\FAILURE
The function {restart} only fails if no goalstack is being managed.

\USES
Restarting an interactive proof.
