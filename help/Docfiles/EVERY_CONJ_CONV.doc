\DOC EVERY_CONJ_CONV

\TYPE {EVERY_CONJ_CONV : conv -> conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies a conversion to every top-level conjunct in a term.

\KEYWORDS
conversion

\DESCRIBE
The term {EVERY_CONJ_CONV c t} takes the conversion {c} and applies
this to every top-level conjunct within term {t}.  A top-level
conjunct is a sub-term that can be reached from the root of the term
by breaking apart only conjunctions.  The terms affected by {c} are
those that would be returned by a call to {strip_conj c}.  In
particular, if the term as a whole is not a conjunction, then the
conversion will be applied to the whole term.

\FAILURE
Fails if the conversion argument fails when applied to any of the
top-level conjuncts in a term.

\EXAMPLE
{
- EVERY_CONJ_CONV BETA_CONV (Term`(\x. x /\ y) p`);
> val it = |- (\x. x /\ y) p = p /\ y : Thm.thm
- EVERY_CONJ_CONV BETA_CONV (Term`(\y. y /\ p) q /\ (\z. z) r`);
> val it = |- (\y. y /\ p) q /\ (\z. z) r = (q /\ p) /\ r : Thm.thm
}

\USES
Useful for applying a conversion to all of the ``significant''
sub-terms within a term without having to worry about the exact
structure of its conjunctive skeleton.
