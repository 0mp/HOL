\TYPE {VALID : tactic -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Makes a tactic fail if it would otherwise return an invalid proof.

\DESCRIBE
If {tac} applied to the goal {(asl,g)} produces a justification that
does not create a theorem {A |- g}, with {A} a subset of {asl}, then
{VALID tac (asl,g)} fails (raises an exception).  If {tac} produces a
valid proof on the goal, then the behaviour of {VALID tac (asl,g)} is
the same

\FAILURE
Fails by design if its argument produces an invalid proof when applied
to a goal.  Also fails if its argument fails when applied to the given
proof.
