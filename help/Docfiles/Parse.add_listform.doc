\SYNOPSIS
Adds a ``list-form'' to the built-in grammar, allowing the parsing of
strings such as {[a; b; c]} and {{}}.

\KEYWORDS
parsing, prettyprinting

\LIBRARY
Parse

\DESCRIBE
The {add_listform} function allows the user to augment the HOL parser
with rules so that it can turn a string of the form
{
   <ld> str1 <sep> str2 <sep> ... strn <rd>
}
into the term
{
   <cons> t1 (<cons> t2 ... (<cons> tn <nilstr>))
}
where {<ld>} is the left delimiter string, {<rd>} the right
delimiter, and {<sep>} is the separator string from the fields of the
record argument to the function.  The various {stri} are strings
representing the {ti} terms.  Further, the grammar will also parse
{<ld> <rd>} into {<nilstr>}.

The {pp_element} lists passed to this function for the {separator},
{leftdelim} and {rightdelim} fields are interpreted as by the
{add_rule} function.  These lists must have exactly one {TOK} element
(this provides the string that will be printed), and other formatting
elements such as {BreakSpace}

In common with the {add_rule} function, there is no requirement that
the {cons} and {nilstr} fields be the names of constants; the
parser/grammar combination will generate variables with these names if
there are no corresponding constants.

The HOL pretty-printer is simultaneously aware of the new rule, and
terms of the forms above will print appropriately.

\FAILURE
Fails if any of the {pp_element} lists are ill-formed: if they include
{TM}, {BeginFinalBlock}, or {EndInitialBlock} elements, or if do not
include exactly one {TOK} element.  Subsequent calls to the term
parser may also fail or behave unpredictably if the strings chosen for
the various fields above introduce precedence conflicts.  For example,
it will almost always be impossible to use left and right delimiters
that are already present in the grammar, unless they are there as the
left and right parts of a closefix.

\EXAMPLE
The definition of the ``list-form'' for lists in the HOL distribution
is:
{
   add_listform {separator = [TOK ";", BreakSpace(1,0)],
                 leftdelim = [TOK "["], rightdelim = [TOK "]"],
                 cons = "CONS", nilstr = "NIL"};
}
while the set syntax is defined similarly:
{
   add_listform {leftdelim = [TOK "{"], rightdelim = TOK ["}"],
                 separator = [";", BreakSpace(1,0)],
                 cons = "INSERT", nilstr = "EMPTY"};
}


\USES
Used to make sequential term structures print and parse more
pleasingly.

\COMMENTS
As with other parsing functions, there is a {temp_add_listform}
version of this function, which has the same effect on the global
grammar, but which does not cause this effect to persist when the
current theory is exported.
