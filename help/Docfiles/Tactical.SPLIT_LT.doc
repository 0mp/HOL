\DOC SPLIT_LT

\TYPE {SPLIT_LT : int -> list_tactic * list_tactic -> list_tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Splits a list of goals into two and applies a list_tactic to each part

\KEYWORDS
list_tactic.

\DESCRIBE
For list_tactics {ltac1} and {ltac2}, integer {n} and goal list {gl},
the application {SPLIT_LT n (ltac1, ltac2) gl} 
applies {ltac1} to the first {n} goals in {gl}, and {ltac2} to the remainder.  
If {n} is negative, {ltac1} is applied to the goals before the last {-n},
and {ltac2} to the last {-n} goals.  

\FAILURE
The application {SPLIT_LT n (ltac1, ltac2)} never fails,
but when applied to a goal list,
it fails if the index {n} is (in absolute value)
larger then the length of the list,
or if either of the list_tactics {ltac1} and {ltac2} fails.

\EXAMPLE
To apply tactic {tac1} to a goal, and then to apply {tac2} 
to all resulting subgoals except the first, use
{
  tac1 THEN_LT SPLIT_LT 1 (ALL_LT, ALLGOALS tac2)
}
