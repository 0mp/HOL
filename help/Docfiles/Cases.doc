goal.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a universally quantified goal, {Cases} performs a
case-split, based on the cases theorem for the type of the universally
quantified variable stored in the global {TypeBase} database.

The cases theorem for a type {ty} will be of the form:
{
   |- !v:ty. (?x11...x1n1. v = C1 x11 ... x1n1) \/ .... \/
             (?xm1...xmnm. v = Cm xm1 ... xmnm)
}
\noindent where there is no requirement for there to be more than one
disjunct, nor for there to be any particular number of existentially
quantified variables in any disjunct.  For example, the cases theorem
for natural numbers initially in the {TypeBase} is:
{
   |- !n. (n = 0) \/ (?m. n = SUC m)
}
Case-splitting consists of specialising the cases theorem with the
variable from the goal and then generating as many sub-goals as there
are disjuncts in the cases theorem, where in each sub-goal the
variable has been replaced by an expression involving the given
``constructor'' (the {Ci}s above) applied to as many fresh variables
as appropriate.

\FAILURE
Fails if the goal is not universally quantified, or if the type of the
universally quantified variable does not have a case theorem in the
{TypeBase}, as will happen, for example, with variable types.
