\DOC save_proof

\TYPE {save_proof : unit -> proof}

\SYNOPSIS
Marks the current proof state as a save point, and clears the automatic undo history.

\DESCRIBE
The function {save_proof} is part of the subgoal package. A call to
{save_proof} clears the automatic proof history and marks the current state as
a save point. A call to {backup} at a save point will fail. In contrast to
{forget_history}, however, {save_proof} does not clear the initial goal or any
previous save points. Therefore a call to {Backup} or {restart} at a save point
will succeed.  For a description of the subgoal package, see {set_goal}.

\FAILURE
The function {save_proof} will fail only if no goalstack is being managed.

\USES
Creating save points in an interactive proof, to allow user-directed back
tracking. This is in contrast to the automatic back tracking facilitated by
{backup}.
