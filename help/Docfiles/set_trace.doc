\DOC set_trace

\TYPE {set_trace : string -> int -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Set a tracing level for a registered trace.

\KEYWORDS
Tracing.

\DESCRIBE

Invoking {set_trace n i} sets the level of the tracing mechanism
registered under {n} to be {i}. These settings control the verboseness
of various tools within the system. This can be useful both when
debugging proofs (with the simplifier for example), and also as a guide
to how an automatic proof is proceeding (with {mesonLib} for example).

There is no single interpretation of what activity a tracing level
should evoke: each tool registered for tracing can treat its trace level
in its own way.

\FAILURE
A call to {set_trace n i} fails if {n} has not previously been 
registered via {register_trace}.

\EXAMPLE
{
    - set_trace "Rewrite" 1;

    - PURE_REWRITE_CONV [AND_CLAUSES] (Term `x /\ T /\ y`);

    <<HOL message: Rewrite:
    |- T /\ y = y.>>

    > val it = |- x /\ T /\ y = x /\ y : thm
}
