\DOC inputonly_type_abbrev

\TYPE {Parse.inputonly_type_abbrev : string * hol_type -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Establishes a type abbreviation for parsing, but not printing.

\KEYWORDS
Parsing, pretty-printing, HOL types.

\DESCRIBE
A call to {inputonly_type_abbrev(s,ty)} establishes {s} as an
abbreviation for the type {ty} (as with a call to
{type_abbrev(s,ty)}), but the pretty-printer for types will not be
changed by this call, so that types matching the pattern {ty} will
print as they did previously.

\FAILURE
Fails if the argument {ty} is a single type variable.

\EXAMPLE
{
   > inputonly_type_abbrev("foo", ``:num``);
   val it = () : unit

   > type_of ``3 + x:foo``;
   val it = ``:num``
}

\COMMENTS
There is a version of this function with name
{temp_inputonly_type_abbrev} that does not cause the effect on the
grammar to be persistent (exported to descendent theories).
