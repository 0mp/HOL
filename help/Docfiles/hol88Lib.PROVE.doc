\TYPE {PROVE : term * tactic -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Attempts to prove a boolean term using the supplied tactic.

\KEYWORDS
apply, tactic, tactical.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term-tactic pair {(tm,tac)}, the function 
{PROVE} attempts to prove the goal {?- tm}, that is, the term {tm}
with no assumptions, using the tactic {tac}. If {PROVE} succeeds, 
it returns the corresponding theorem {A |- tm}, where
the assumption list {A} may not be empty if the tactic is invalid;
{PROVE} has no inbuilt validity-checking.

\FAILURE
Fails if the term is not of type {bool} (and so cannot possibly be the
conclusion of a theorem), or if the tactic cannot solve the goal. Also
fails if the hol88 library has not been loaded.
