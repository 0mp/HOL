\BLTYPE
remove_user_printer : 
    {{Thy:string, Tyop:string}} -> term_pp_types.userprinter option
\ELTYPE

\SYNOPSIS
Removes a user-defined pretty-printing function for a given type.

\KEYWORDS
Pretty-printing.

\LIBRARY Parse

\DESCRIBE
This removes a user-defined pretty-printing function for a given type
(or family of types, generated by a type operator).  If there is such
a printer in the global grammar for the specified type, this is
returned in the option type.  If there is no printer, then {NONE} is
returned.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\COMMENTS
As always, there is an accompanying function
{temp_remove_user_printer}, which does not affect the grammar exported
to disk.
