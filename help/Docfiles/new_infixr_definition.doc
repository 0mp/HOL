\TYPE {Parse.new_infixr_definition : (string * term * int) -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Declares a new right associative infix constant and installs a
definition in the current theory.


\KEYWORDS definition, parsing, infix

\LIBRARY Parse

\DESCRIBE
The function {new_infixr_definition} has exactly the same effect as
{new_infixl_definition} except that the infix constant defined will
associate to the right.

\FAILURE
{new_infixr_definition} fails if there is already an axiom, definition
or specification of the given name in an ancestral theory segment; if
{`ix`} is not an allowed name for a constant; if {t} contains free
variables that are not in either of the variable structures {v_1} and
{v_2} (this is equivalent to requiring {\v_1 v_2. t} to be a closed
term); or if any variable occurs more than once in {v_1, v_2}.  It
also fails if the precedence level chosen for the infix is already
home to parsing rules of a different form of fixity (infixes
associating in a different way, or suffixes, prefixes etc).  Finally,
failure occurs if there is a type variable in {v_1}, ..., {v_n} or {t}
that does not occur in the type of {ix}.
