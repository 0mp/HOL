\TYPE {mk_thm : term list * term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Creates an arbitrary theorem (dangerous!)

\DESCRIBE
The function {mk_thm} can be used to construct an arbitrary theorem. It is
applied to a pair consisting of the desired assumption list (possibly empty)
and conclusion. All the terms therein should be of type {bool}.
{
   mk_thm([a1,...,an],c) = ({{a1,...,an}} |- c)
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless all the terms provided for assumptions and conclusion are of type
{bool}.

\EXAMPLE
The following shows how to create a simple contradiction:
{
   - mk_thm([],boolSyntax.F);
   val it = |- F : thm
}
\COMMENTS
Although {mk_thm} can be useful for experimentation or temporarily plugging
gaps, its use should be avoided if at all possible in important proofs, because
it can be used to create theorems leading to contradictions. The example above
is a trivial case, but it is all too easy to create a contradiction by
asserting `obviously sound' theorems.

All theorems which are likely to be needed can be derived using only HOL's
inbuilt axioms and primitive inference rules, which are provably sound (see
the DESCRIPTION). Basing all proofs, normally via derived rules and tactics, on
just these axioms and inference rules gives proofs which are (apart from bugs
in HOL or the underlying system) completely secure. This is one of the great
strengths of HOL, and it is foolish to sacrifice it to save a little work.
