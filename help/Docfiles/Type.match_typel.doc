\BLTYPE {match_typel : hol_type list -> hol_type -> hol_type 
        -> (hol_type, hol_type) subst}
\ELTYPE

\SYNOPSIS
Match types with restrictions.

\KEYWORDS
type, matching.

\DESCRIBE
An invocation {match_typel away pat ty} matches {pat} to {ty} in the
same way as {match_type}, but prohibits any of the type variables in {away}
from being instantiated. In effect, the elements of {away}, although
type variables, are treated as constants in {pat} during the matching
process. 

\FAILURE
An invocation of {match_typel away pat ty} will fail 
if {match_type pat ty} would fail. It will also fail if {match_type pat ty} 
would succeed giving a substitution 
{[{{redex_1,residue_1}},...,{{redex_n,residue_n}}]} where one or more of the
{redex_i} are members of {away}.

\EXAMPLE
In the first example, we perform a normal match operation
{
   - match_typel [] (alpha --> beta --> gamma)
                    (bool --> ind --> delta);
   > val it = [{{redex = `:'c`, residue = `:'d`}}, 
               {{redex = `:'b`, residue = `:ind`}},
               {{redex = `:'a`, residue = `:bool`}}] : ...
}
\noindent Now we require that {gamma}, although a type variable in the
pattern, not be instantiable. In the first try, the match succeeds because
{'c} is mapped only to itself. In the second, it fails because an
association is made between {'c} and {'d}.
{
   - match_typel [gamma] (alpha --> beta --> gamma)
                         (bool --> ind --> gamma);
   > val it = [{{redex = `:'b`, residue = `:ind`}},
               {{redex = `:'a`, residue = `:bool`}}] : ...

   - match_typel [gamma] (alpha --> beta --> gamma)
                         (bool --> ind --> delta);
   ! Uncaught exception: 
   ! HOL_ERR
}

\COMMENTS
The use of {away} allows matching to take account of type variables that
are 'frozen' (by occurring in the hypotheses of a theorem, for example).
This allows certain fruitless proof attempts to be avoided at the matching
stage.
