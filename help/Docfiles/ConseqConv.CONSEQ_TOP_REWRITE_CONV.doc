\DOC CONSEQ_TOP_REWRITE_CONV

\TYPE {CONSEQ_TOP_REWRITE_CONV : thm list -> directed_conseq_conv}

\SYNOPSIS
An extended version of {MATCH_MP}. 

\DESCRIBE 
The theorems in the theorem list are split along
conjunctions and allquantification is removed. Then theorems with
toplevel negation {|- ~P} are rewritten to {|- P = F}. Afterwards
every theorem {|- P} that is not an implication or an boolean equation
is replaced by {|- P = T}. Finally, boolean equations {|- P = Q} are
splitted into two theorems {|- P ==> Q} and {|- Q ==> P}. One ends up
with a list of implications.

Given a term {t} the conversion tries 
to find a theorem {|- P ==> Q} and - depending on to the direction - 
strengthen {t} by matching it with {Q} or weaken it by
matching it with {P}.

\EXAMPLE
This directed consequence conversion is intended to be used together
with {DEPTH_CONSEQ_CONV}. The combination of both is called
{CONSEQ_REWRITE_CONV}. Please have a look there for an example.
