\TYPE {repeat : ('a -> 'a) -> 'a -> 'a}

\SYNOPSIS Apply a function iteratively until it fails.

\KEYWORDS iteration.

\DESCRIBE 

An invocation {repeat f x} evaluates to {repeat f (f x)}. When an invocation 
{f y} finally fails, for some {y}, then {y} is returned.

\FAILURE

If an {Interrupt} exception is generated during an application of {f}, then 
{repeat f x} raises {Interrupt}.

\EXAMPLE
On a machine with fixed width integers, the following will compute 
the largest representable integer:
{
    repeat (fn x => x+1) 0
}
