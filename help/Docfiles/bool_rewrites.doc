\DOC bool_rewrites

\TYPE {bool_rewrites: unit -> rewrites}

\SYNOPSIS
Contains a number of built-in tautologies used, by default, in rewriting.

\DESCRIBE
The variable {bool_rewrites} represents a kind of database of rewrite rules 
commonly used to simplify expressions. These rules include the clause for
reflexivity:
{
   |- !x. (x = x) = T
}
\noindent as well as rules to reason about equality:
{
   |- !t.
      ((T = t) = t) /\ ((t = T) = t) /\ ((F = t) = ~t) /\ ((t = F) = ~t)
}
Negations are manipulated by the following clauses:
{
   |- (!t. ~~t = t) /\ (~T = F) /\ (~F = T)
}
The set of tautologies includes truth tables for conjunctions,
disjunctions, and implications:
{
   |- !t.
       (T /\ t = t) /\
       (t /\ T = t) /\
       (F /\ t = F) /\
       (t /\ F = F) /\
       (t /\ t = t)
   |- !t.
       (T \/ t = T) /\
       (t \/ T = T) /\
       (F \/ t = t) /\
       (t \/ F = t) /\
       (t \/ t = t)
   |- !t.
       (T ==> t = t) /\
       (t ==> T = T) /\
       (F ==> t = T) /\
       (t ==> t = T) /\
       (t ==> F = ~t)
}
Simple rules for reasoning about conditionals are given by:
{
   |- !t1 t2. ((T => t1 | t2) = t1) /\ ((F => t1 | t2) = t2)
}
Rewriting with the following tautologies allows simplification of
universally and existentially quantified variables and abstractions:
{
   |- !t. (!x. t) = t
   |- !t. (?x. t) = t
   |- !t1 t2. (\x. t1)t2 = t1
}
\USES
The {bool_rewrites} are automatically included in the simplifications 
performed by some of the rewriting tools.

The {bool_rewrites} used to include rules for reasoning about
pairs in HOL:
{
   |- !x. FST x,SND x = x
   |- !x y. FST(x,y) = x
   |- !x y. SND(x,y) = y
}
However, because of recent changes in the system, the theory of pairs 
need not be loaded at the same time as the "bool" theory, so the 
above rewrites can be accessed through {pairTheory.pair_rws}.
