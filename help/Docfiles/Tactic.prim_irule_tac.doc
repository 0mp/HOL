\TYPE {prim_irule_tac : thm_tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
For a goal which is an instance of the conclusion of the supplied theorem,
replace the goal by the instantiated hypotheses of the supplied theorem.

\KEYWORDS
tactic.

\DESCRIBE
When given a theorem {A' |- t} and a goal {A ?- t'} where {t} can be matched
to {t'} by instantiating free variables,
including appropriate type instantiation,
{prim_irule_tac} replaces the goal by new subgoals which are the hypotheses
{A'}, instantiated

\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem has a conclusion which is instantiable to match that
of the goal.

\COMMENTS
{irule} also pre-processes the supplied theorem, which will normally be useful

{irule} differs from {MATCH_ACCEPT_TAC} in that hypotheses of the supplied
theorem may also be substituted, and will appear as new subgoals
