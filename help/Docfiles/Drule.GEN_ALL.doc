\TYPE {Drule.GEN_ALL : thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Generalizes the conclusion of a theorem over its own free variables.

\KEYWORDS
rule, quantifier, universal.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- t}, the inference rule {GEN_ALL}
returns the theorem {A |- !x1...xn. t}, where the {xi} are all the
variables, if any, which are free in {t} but not in the assumptions.
{
         A |- t
   ------------------  GEN_ALL
    A |- !x1...xn. t
}
\FAILURE
Never fails.

\COMMENTS

WARNING: hol90 {GEN_ALL} does not always return the same result as
{GEN_ALL} in hol88.  Sometimes people write code that depends on the
order of the quantification. They shouldn't.
