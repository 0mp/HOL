\DOC dest_const

\TYPE {dest_const : term -> string * hol_type}

\SYNOPSIS
Breaks apart a constant into name and type.

\DESCRIBE
{dest_const} is a term destructor for constants. If {M} is a 
constant with name {c} and type {ty}, then {dest_const M}
returns {(c,ty)}.

\FAILURE
Fails if {M} is not a constant.

\COMMENTS

In Hol98, constants also carry the theory they are declared in. A 
more precise and robust way to analyze a constant is with 
{dest_thy_const}.
