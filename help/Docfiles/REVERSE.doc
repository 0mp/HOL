\DOC REVERSE

\TYPE {REVERSE : (tactic -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Reverses the order of the generated subgoals.

\KEYWORDS
tactical.

\DESCRIBE
The tactic {REVERSE T} is a tactic which applies {T} to a goal, and reverses
the order of the subgoals generated by {T}.

\FAILURE
The application of {REVERSE} to a tactic {T} never fails. The
resulting composite tactic {REVERSE T} fails when applied to a goal if
and only if {T} fails.

\COMMENTS
Intended for use with {THEN1} to pick the 'easy' subgoal.

\EXAMPLE
Given a goal
{
   G1 /\ G2
}
\noindent use
{
  CONJ_TAC THEN1 T0
  THEN ...
}
\noindent if the first conjunct is easily dispatched with {T0}, and
{
  REVERSE CONJ_TAC THEN1 T0
  THEN ...
}
\noindent if it is the second conjunct that yields.

\SEEALSO
EVERY, FIRST, ORELSE, THEN, THEN1, THENL.
