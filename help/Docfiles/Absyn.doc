\TYPE {Parse.Absyn : term quotation -> Absyn.absyn}

\SYNOPSIS
Implements the first phase of term parsing; the removal of special syntax.

\KEYWORDS
Parsing

\LIBRARY Parse

\DESCRIBE
The ``let'' expression {`let x = e1 in e2`} will turn into
{
   APP(APP(IDENT "LET", LAM(VIDENT "x", IDENT "e2")), IDENT "e1")
}
\noindent The record syntax {`rec.fld1`} is converted into something of
the form
{
   APP(IDENT "....fld1", IDENT "rec")
}
\noindent where the dots will actually be equal to the value of
{GrammarSpecials.recsel_special} (a string).

\FAILURE
Fails if the quotation provided includes a syntax error.  This phase
of parsing is unconcerned with types, and will happily parse
meaningless expressions that are syntactically valid.
