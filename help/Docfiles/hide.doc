\TYPE {hide : string -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Stops the quotation parser from recognizing a constant.

\DESCRIBE
A call {hide "c"} where {c} is the name of a constant, will prevent
the quotation parser from parsing it as such; it will just be parsed
as a variable.  The effect can be reversed by {Parse.reveal "c"}.
However, this call does not affect the treatment of overloaded
constants.  If {"+"} is overloaded (to addition over the naturals and
integers, for example), then {hide "+"} will not affect its parsing.
This must be achieved by first removing the overloading, using
{clear_overloads_on}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\COMMENTS
The hiding of a constant only affects the quotation parser; the
constant is still there in a theory.  Further, (re-)defining a string
hidden with {hide} will reveal it once more.
