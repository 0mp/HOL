\TYPE {hide : string -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS

Stops the quotation parser from recognizing a constant.

\DESCRIBE
A call {hide "c"} where {c} is the name of a constant, will
prevent the quotation parser from parsing it as such; it will just be parsed as
a variable. The effect can be reversed by {Parse.reveal "c"}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\COMMENTS
The hiding of a constant only affects the quotation parser; the constant is
still there in a theory.

\SEEALSO
Parse.reveal, Parse.hidden.
