\TYPE {subtract : ''a list -> ''a list -> ''a list}

\SYNOPSIS
Computes the set-theoretic difference of two `sets'.

\KEYWORDS
list, set.

\DESCRIBE
{subtract l1 l2} returns a list consisting of those elements of {l1} that do
not appear in {l2}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
- subtract [1,2,3] [3,5,4,1];
val it = [2] : int list

- subtract [1,2,4,1] [4,5];
val it = [1, 2, 1] : int list
}

\COMMENTS
Several high performance implementations of finite sets may be found in
the SML Standard Library.
