\TYPE {parents : string -> string list}

\SYNOPSIS
Lists the parent theories of a named theory.

\DESCRIBE
The function {parents} returns a list of strings that identify the
parent theories of a named theory. The function does not recursively
descend the theory hierarchy in search of the `leaf' theories.
The named theory must be the current theory or an ancestor of the
current theory.

\FAILURE
Fails if the named theory is not an ancestor of the current theory.

\EXAMPLE
Initially, the only parent is the basic {bool} theory:
{
   - new_theory "myTheory";
   <<HOL message: Created theory "myTheory">>
   > val it = () : unit

   - parents "myTheory";
   > val it = ["bool"] : string list

   - load "bossLib"; 
   > val it = () : unit

   - parents "-";
   > val it = ["list", "option"] : string list

   - parents "option";
    > val it = ["sum", "one"] : string list

   - parents "string";
   ! Uncaught exception: 
   ! HOL_ERR
}
\noindent However, loading the string library creates another
link in the theory graph:
{
   - load "stringLib";
   > val it = () : unit

   - parents "string";
   > val it = ["list"] : string list

   - parents "myTheory";
   > val it = ["string", "option"] : string list
}
