\DOC wlog_then

\TYPE {wlog_then : term quotation -> term quotation list -> thm_tactic -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Apply a theorem-tactic using a proposition that can be assumed without loss of
generality.

\DESCRIBE
Like {wlog_tac}, but the theorem {P |- P} is passed to the user-provided
theorem-tactic instead of {strip_assume_tac}.

\FAILURE
Never fails when applied to a theorem-tactical. The resulting tactic fails if
and only if the user-provided theorem-tactical fails when used as a tactic
(i.e.: when applied to a theorem and a goal).
