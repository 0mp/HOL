\TYPE {Parse.reveal : string -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Restores recognition of a constant by the quotation parser.

\DESCRIBE
A call {reveal "c"}, where {c} is a (perhaps) hidden constant, will
unhide the constant, that is, will make the quotation parser recognize
it as such rather than treating it as a variable. It reverses the
effect of the call {Parse.hide "c"}.

\FAILURE
Never fails, but prints a warning message if the string does not
correspond to an actual constant.

\COMMENTS
The hiding of a constant only affects the quotation parser;
the constant is still there in a theory.

\SEEALSO
Parse.hide, Parse.hidden.
