\TYPE {new_axiom : string * term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Install a new axiom in the current theory.

\DESCRIBE
If {tm} is a term of type {bool}, a call {new_axiom("name",tm)} 
creates a theorem
{
   |- !x1..xn. tm
}
and stores it away in the theory file. Note that all free
variables in {tm} are generalized automatically before the axiom is 
created.

\FAILURE
Fails if the given term does not have type {bool}.

\EXAMPLE
{
  - new_theory "gurk";
  () : unit

  - new_axiom("untrue",--`x = 1`--));
  |- !x. x = 1
}


\COMMENTS
For most purposes, it is unnecessary to declare new axioms: all of classical
mathematics can be derived by definitional extension alone. Proceeding
by definition is not only more elegant, but also guarantees the
consistency of the deductions made. However, there are certain entities
which cannot be modelled in simple type theory without further axioms,
such as higher transfinite ordinals.
