\TYPE {HOLSimps.hol_ss : simpset}

\SYNOPSIS
The most powerful simpset provided by the HOL system.

\KEYWORDS simplification.

\LIBRARY HOLSimps

\DESCRIBE
The {hol_ss} simpset includes simplifications appropriate for use with
the theories of pairs, sums, options, lists, and numbers.  It includes
an arithmetic decision procedure for linear arithmetic over the
natural numbers ({ARITH_CONV}) and a variety of other powerful
techniques.  The way in which these components are applied to terms is
described in the entry for {SIMP_CONV}.

\FAILURE
Can't fail as it is not a functional value.

\EXAMPLE
{
- SIMP_CONV hol_ss []
    (Term`P (2 * 2) /\ (P 4 ==> (x = y + 3)) ==> P x /\ y < x`);
> val it =
    |- P (2 * 2) /\ (P 4 ==> (x = y + 3)) ==> P x /\ y < x =
       P 4 /\ (P 4 ==> (x = y + 3)) ==> P (y + 3)
    : thm
}
\COMMENTS
It can be very difficult to predict what simplification will manage to
do to one's terms.
