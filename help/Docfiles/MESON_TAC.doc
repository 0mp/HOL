\TYPE {mesonLib.MESON_TAC : thm list -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Performs first order proof search to prove the goal, using the given
theorems as additional assumptions in the search.

\KEYWORDS decision procedure, tactic.

\DESCRIBE

{MESON_TAC} performs first order proof using the model elimination
algorithm to do so.  This algorithm is semi-complete for pure first
order logic.  It makes special provision for handling polymorphic
and higher-order values, and often this is sufficient.  It does not
handle conditional expressions at all, and these should be eliminated
before {MESON_TAC} is applied.

The feedback given by {MESON_TAC} is controlled by the level of the
integer reference variable {mesonLib.chatting}.  At level zero,
nothing is printed.  At the default level of one, a line of dots is
printed out as the proof progresses.  At all other values for this
variable, {MESON_TAC} is most verbose.  If the proof is progressing
quickly then it is often worth waiting for it to go quite deep into
its search.  Once a proof slows down, it is not usually worth waiting
for it after it has gone through a few (no more than five or six)
levels.  (At level one, a ``level'' is represented by the printing of
a single dot.)

\FAILURE

{MESON_TAC} fails if it searches to a depth equal to the contents of
the reference variable {mesonLib.max_depth} (set to 30 by default, but
changeable by the user) without finding a proof.  Shouldn't fail
otherwise.

\COMMENTS
The assumptions of a goal are ignored when {MESON_TAC} is applied.  To
include assumptions use {ASM_MESON_TAC}.
