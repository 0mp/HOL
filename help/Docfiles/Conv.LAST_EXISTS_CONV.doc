\DESCRIBE
Application of {LAST_EXISTS_CONV c} to the term
{``?x1 .. xn x. body``} will apply {c} to the term {``?x. body``}.
If the result of this application is the term {t}, then the result of
the whole will be {``?x1 .. xn. t``}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the term is not existentially quantified, or if the
conversion {c} fails when it is applied.
