\TYPE {BasicProvers.export_rewrites : string list -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Exports theorems so that they merge with the ``stateful'' rewriter's {simpset}.

\KEYWORDS
simplification

\LIBRARY BasicProvers

\DESCRIBE
A call to {export_rewrites strlist} causes the theorems named by the
strings in {strlist} to be merged into the {simpset} value maintained
behind the function {srw_ss()} when the theory generated by the script
file is loaded.

The theory is also augmented with an element in its signature of the
form {<thyname>_rwts} of type {simpLib.ssdata}.  This value is the
collection of all the theorems specified in the previous call to
{export_rewrites}.

\FAILURE
Never fails directly.  However, if a string in the parameter does not
correspond to a theorem exported by the theory (using {save_thm},
say), then the theory file resulting from the execution of the script
that includes the call to {export_rewrites} will not compile.
