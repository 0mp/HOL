\DOC export_rewrites

\TYPE {export_rewrites : string list -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Exports theorems so that they merge with the ``stateful'' rewriter's {simpset}.

\KEYWORDS
simplification

\DESCRIBE
A call to {export_rewrites strlist} causes the theorems named by the
strings in {strlist} to be merged into the {simpset} value maintained
behind the function {srw_ss()}, both in the current session and also
when the theory generated by the script file is loaded.

The theory is also augmented with an element in its signature of the
form {<thyname>_rwts} of type {simpLib.ssdata}.  This value is the
collection of all the theorems specified in calls to
{export_rewrites}.

Multiple calls to {export_rewrites} cumulatively add to the list of
theorems being exported.

\FAILURE
Fails if any of the strings in the list does not correspond to the
name of a theorem, definition or axiom of the current theory segment.

\COMMENTS
This function is useful for ensuring that the stateful rewriter is
augmented as theories are loaded.  This in turn means that users of
these theories don't need to learn the names of their ``obvious''
theorems.  Because theorems can not be removed from the stateful
rewriter's underlying {simpset}, choice of ``obvious'' theorems needs
to be done with care.
