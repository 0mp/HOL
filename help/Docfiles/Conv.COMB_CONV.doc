\DOC COMB_CONV

\TYPE {COMB_CONV : conv -> conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies a conversion to both immediate sub-terms of an application.

\KEYWORDS
conversional.

\DESCRIBE
If {t} is an application term of the form {f x}, and {c} is a
conversion, such that {c} maps {f} to {|- f = f'} and {x} to
{|- x = x'}, then {COMB_CONV c} maps {t} to {|- f x = f' x'}.

\FAILURE
{COMB_CONV c t} fails if {t} is not an application term, or if {c}
fails when applied to the rator and rand of {t}, or if {c} is not in
fact a conversion (i.e., a function which maps terms {t} to a theorem
{|- t = t'}.
