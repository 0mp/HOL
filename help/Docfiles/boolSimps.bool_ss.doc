\TYPE {boolSimps.bool_ss : simpset}

\SYNOPSIS
Basic simpset containing standard propositional calculus rewrites,
beta conversion, and eta conversion.

\KEYWORDS simplification

\LIBRARY boolSimps

\DESCRIBE
The {bool_ss} simpset is almost at the base of the system-provided
simpset hierarchy.  Though not very powerful, it does include rewrite
rules such as {|- T /\ P = P}, conversions to perform eta and beta
reduction, and congruence rules to let simplification get additional
contextual information as it descends through implications and
congruences.

\FAILURE
Can't fail, as it is not a functional value.

\USES
The {bool_ss} simpset is an appropriate simpset to use at the base of
new user-defined simpsets, and is also useful in its own right where a
delicate simplification is desired, where other more powerful
simpsets might cause undue disruption to a goal.  If even less
system rewriting is desired, the {pure_ss} value can be used.
