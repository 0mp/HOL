\TYPE {hol88Lib : hol88Lib_sig}

\SYNOPSIS
A structure that provides a limited form of compatibility between
hol90 and hol88.

\DESCRIBE
The {hol88Lib} structure is intended to provide hol88 functions and
functionality otherwise lacking in hol90. To operate much as in hol88,
one would open {Psyntax} and {hol88Lib}. Warning: the {hol88Lib}
structure is by no means complete!

\FAILURE
The library hol88 must be loaded in order to get access to {hol88Lib}.

\SEEALSO
