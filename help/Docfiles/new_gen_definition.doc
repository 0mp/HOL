\TYPE {Parse.new_gen_definition : (string * term * fixity) -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Defines a new constant and associates it with a parsing fixity.

\DESCRIBE

The function {new_gen_definition} provides a facility for definitional
extensions to the current theory.  It takes a tuple of three
arguments.  The first component of this tuple is the name under which
the resulting definition will be saved in the current theory segment.
The second component is a term giving the desired definition.  The
third component is a fixity (typically one of {Binder}, {Infixl n},
{Infixr n}, {Suffix n}, {TruePrefix n} or {Closefix}).  The value
returned by {new_gen_definition} is a theorem which states the
definition requested by the user.

Let {v_1},...,{v_n} be tuples of distinct variables, containing the variables
{x_1,...,x_m}.  Evaluating
{new_gen_definition flag (`name`, "c v_1 ... v_n = t")}, where {c} is not
already a constant, declares the sequent {({{}},"\v_1 ... v_n. t")} to
be a definition in the current theory, and declares {c} to be a new
constant in the current theory with this definition as its
specification.  This constant specification is returned as a theorem,
generally of the form {|- !x_1 ... x_m. c v_1 ... v_n = t} , and is
saved in the current theory under (the name) {name}.  If {flag} is
{`infix`} or {`binder`}, the constant is given infix or binder status
accordingly.  Optionally, the definitional term argument may have any
of its variables universally quantified.

\FAILURE

{new_gen_definition} fails if there is already an axiom, definition or
specification of the given name in an ancestral theory segment; if {c}
is not an allowed name for a constant; if {t} contains free variables
that are not in any of the variable structures {v_1}, ..., {v_n} (this
is equivalent to requiring {\v_1 ... v_n. t} to be a closed term); or
if any variable occurs more than once in {v_1, ..., v_n}. Finally,
failure occurs if there is a type variable in {v_1}, ..., {v_n} or {t}
that does not occur in the type of {c}.
