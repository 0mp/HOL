\ELTYPE

\SYNOPSIS
Introduces a constant or constants satisfying a given property.

\DESCRIBE
The ML function {new_specification} implements the primitive rule of
constant specification for the HOL logic.
Evaluating:
{
   new_specification {{name = "name", sat_thm = |- ?x1...xn. t,
                      consts = [{{const_name = "c1", fixity = f1}}, ...,
                                {{const_name = "cn", fixity = fn}}]}}
}
\noindent simultaneously introduces new constants named {c1},...,{cn}
satisfying the property:
{
   |- t[c1,...,cn/x1,...,xn]
}
\noindent This theorem is stored, with name {name}, as a definition in
the current theory segment. It is also returned by the call to
{new_specification} The fixities {f1}, ..., {fn} are values which
determine the parsing status of the new constants. Typical fixity
values are {Prefix}, {Binder}, {Infixl n}, {Infixr n}, {Suffix n},
{TruePrefix n} or {Closefix}. 

\FAILURE
{new_specification} fails if the theorem argument has assumptions or
free variables. It also fails if the supplied constant names 
{"c1"}, ..., {"cn"} are not distinct. Finally, failure occurs if
some {ci} does not contain all the type variables that occur in 
the term {?x1...xn. t}. 

\USES
{new_specification} can be used to introduce constants that satisfy a given
property without having to make explicit equational constant definitions for
them.  For example, the built-in constants {MOD} and {DIV} are defined in the
system by first proving the theorem:
{
   th |- ?MOD DIV.
         !n. (0 < n) ==>
             !k. ((k = (((DIV k n) * n) + (MOD k n))) /\ ((MOD k n) < n))
}
\noindent and then making the constant specification:
{
   - val DIVISION = 
        new_specification
            {{name = "DIVISION",
             consts = [{{fixity = Infixl 650, const_name = "MOD"}},
                       {{fixity = Infixl 600, const_name = "DIV"}}],
             sat_thm = th}};
}
\noindent This introduces the constants {MOD} and {DIV} with the defining
property shown above.
