\TYPE {new_constant : string * hol_type -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Declares a new constant in the current theory.

\DESCRIBE
A call {new_constant(n,ty)} makes {n} a constant in the current
theory. Note that it does not specify its value. The constant may have a 
polymorphic type, which can be used in arbitrary instantiations.

\FAILURE
Never fails, but issues a warning if the name is not a valid constant
name. It will overwrite an existing constant with the same name in
the current theory.
