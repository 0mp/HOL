\TYPE {boolSimps.bool_ss : simpset}

\SYNOPSIS
Basic simpset containing standard propositional calculus rewrites,
beta conversion, and eta conversion.

\KEYWORDS simplification

\LIBRARY boolSimps

\DESCRIBE
The {bool_ss} simpset is at the base of the system-provided simpset
hierarchy.  It includes rewrite rules such as {|- T /\ P = P}, and
conversions to perform eta and beta reduction.

\FAILURE
Can't fail, as it is not a functional value.

\USES
The {bool_ss} simpset is an appropriate simpset to use at the base of
new user-defined simpsets, and is also useful in its own right where a
delicate simplification is desired, where other more powerful
simpsets might cause undue disruption to a goal.
