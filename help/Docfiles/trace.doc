\TYPE {trace : string -> int -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Sets a tracing variable to a new value.

\KEYWORDS
Tracing.

\DESCRIBE
The {trace} function is used to set the value of a tracing variable.
These variable control the verboseness of various tools within the
system.  The higher these numbers, the more verbose the tools become.
This can be useful both when debugging proofs (with the simplifier for
example), and also as a guide to how an automatic proof is proceeding
(with {mesonLib} for example).

A call to {trace nm v} attempts to set the tracing variable associated
with the string {nm} to value {v}.  A tracing variable is associated
with a string by registering it using the function {register_trace}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the name given is not associated with a registered tracing
variable.

\EXAMPLE
{
- REWRITE_CONV [] (Term`p /\ T /\ q`);
> val it = |- p /\ T /\ q = p /\ q : Thm.thm
- trace "rewrite" 1;
> val it = () : unit
- REWRITE_CONV [] (Term`p /\ T /\ q`);
<<HOL message: Rewrite:
|- T /\ q = q.>>
> val it = |- p /\ T /\ q = p /\ q : Thm.thm
}
