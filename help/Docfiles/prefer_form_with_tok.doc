\DOC prefer_form_with_tok

\TYPE {Parse.prefer_form_with_tok : {{term_name : string, tok : string}} -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Sets a grammar rule's preferred flag, causing it to be preferentially printed.

\KEYWORDS
Pretty-printing

\LIBRARY Parse

\DESCRIBE
A call to {prefer_form_with_tok} causes the parsing/pretty-printing
rule specified by the {term_name}-{tok} combination to be the
preferred rule for pretty-printing purposes.  This change affects
the global grammar.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
The initially preferred rule for conditional expressions causes them
to print using the {if-then-else} syntax.  If the user prefers the
``traditional'' syntax with {=>}-{|}, this change can be brought about
as follows:
{
   - prefer_form_with_tok {{term_name = "COND", tok = "=>"}};
   > val it = () : unit
   - Term`if p then q else r`;
   <<HOL message: inventing new type variable names: 'a.>>
   > val it = `p => q | r` : term
}


\COMMENTS
As the example above demonstrates, using this function does not affect the
parser at all.

There is a companion {temp_prefer_form_with_tok} function, which has
the same effect on the global grammar, but which does not cause this
effect to persist when the current theory is exported.
