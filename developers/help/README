This directory contains a hacked version of a utility used in making the
database for the MoscowML `help' function. We have used some of the
source to build help databases for HOL.

When the HOL theories have all been built, typing
  make
in this directory will create an index file for the HOL distribution.
This help database will index all of the .doc files in the
distribution, as well as selected .sig files.  The .sig files indexed
include some Theory files, so this is why the index building should be
done after a complete build has been done.

The file
  tools/documentation-directories
contains a list of directories that will be searched for .doc files,
and all those found there will be indexed (and also turned into .adoc)
files.

The source for mk_dbs.sml also contains a list of .sig files that are
indexed (all taken from the sigobj directory).  This list will
probably be moved into a file like
  tools/documentation-directories
eventually.

The index is installed at
  help/HOLdbase
