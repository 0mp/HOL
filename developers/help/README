This directory contains a hacked version of a utility used in making the
database for the MoscowML `help' function. We have used some of the
source to build help databases for HOL.

When the HOL theories have all been built, typing
  make
in this directory will create an index file for the HOL distribution.


The file   docdirs   contains a list of directories that will be
searched for .doc files, and all those found there will be indexed
(and also turned into .adoc) files.

This directory contains the program used to create the database used
by the Moscow ML `help' function.  It requires the Moscow ML compiler
sources to be installed and compiled.

The program illustrates the use of several libraries.

The main program is makebase.  It reads the signatures in directory
mosml/lib/ and creates

    * a help database in helpsigs.val
    * an ASCII format version of the database in index.txt
    * a LaTeX format  version of the database in index.tex

To create the main program, type

	make

To run the program thus compiled, type

	makebase
