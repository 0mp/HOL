Brief notes on the use of CVS tags in the hol98 source repository.
------------------------------------------------------------------

If working on branch <b>, then the following tags should be defined:

 <b>_branch:
     the branch tag
 <b>_branch_point:
     a normal tag on the main branch where branch <b> begins
 <b>_branch_ends:
     a normal tag on branch <b> where the branch ends and/or is about
     to participate in a merge
 <b>_branch_merge_begins:
     a normal tag on the main branch, where a merge from branch <b> is
     about to begin
 <b>_branch_merge_ends:
     a normal tag on the main branch, after a merge from branch <b>
     has been done and everything cleaned up.

Current branches:
-----------------
  term_with_closure:
      initiated by Bruno Barras as an investigation into representing
      substitutions as closures. Work from this branch was merged back
      into the main branch, but by hand, not using CVS, so it should
      be regarded as finished.

  parse:
      initiated by Michael Norrish as a reworking of the hol90 parser.
      Finished, and merged back into the main branch to start the
      Taupo series of releases.

  athabasca5:
      initiated by Michael Norrish to branch off from the athabasca-4
      release and allow a release fixing problems in athabasca-4
      without interfering with the development of Taupo releases.

      There shouldn't be an athabasca-6 release at all, but if there
      was, it could still sit on this branch.  The only need for the
      branch is to allow improvements to athabasca-5 to be released
      without having to also release the new Taupo parser.

  taupo-5-fixes-branch:
      initiated to branch off from the taupo-5 release to provide a
      taupo-6 release, while work continues on the Kananaskis series.
      No intention to merge back into main branch.

  kananaskis-1-fixes-branch:
      initiated to allow release of Kananaskis-2, which does nothing
      other than fix the Overflow bug.  No intention to merge back
      into main branch.

Other tags:
-----------
  athabasca-4        - a semi-official release, used as the basis for
                       much of the first year's work on the Prosper
                       project.

  athabasca-5        - another semi-official release, fixing
                       athabasca-4 to run under MoscowML 1.44, and
                       also fixing a bug in the string library.

  kananaskis-1       - release on the main branch (7 June 2002)

  kananaskis-2       - release on the kananaskis-1-fixes-branch
                       (8 March 2004)

  now-need-mosml-144 - tag marking switch to MoscowML 1.44 on the main
                       branch.

  post-holset-change - tag marking state of "Kananaskis-0" immediately
                       after implementation of change described below
                       under "pre-holset-change".

  pre-holset-change  - tag marking state of "Kananaskis-0" immediately
                       before implementation of fairly radical change
                       to representation of theorems (using binary
                       trees to store hypotheses), adoption of a
                       different higher order matcher, and general
                       incorporation of "HOL sets" in lots of places.

  pre-kananaskis     - last known point on main branch at which system is
                       known to build as a Taupo release.  Includes
                       minor bug fixes above taupo-5.

  pre-mn-typebase-change -
                       point immediately before Michael Norrish
                       changed TypeBase to have more "user-friendly"
                       functions at the top-level.

  start              - beginning of the repository, version slightly
                       predating athabasca-4

  taupo-[1-5]        - releases on the main branch.  (There was a
                       taupo-6 release too, but there isn't a tag for
                       it (bad!).  Instead, assume that what was
                       released is the tip of the
                       taupo-5-fixes-branch.)
