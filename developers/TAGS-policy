Brief notes on the use of CVS tags in the hol98 source repository.
------------------------------------------------------------------

If working on branch <b>, then the following tags should be defined:

 <b>_branch:
     the branch tag
 <b>_branch_point:
     a normal tag on the main branch where branch <b> begins
 <b>_branch_ends:
     a normal tag on branch <b> where the branch ends and/or is about
     to participate in a merge
 <b>_branch_merge_begins:
     a normal tag on the main branch, where a merge from branch <b> is
     about to begin
 <b>_branch_merge_ends:
     a normal tag on the main branch, after a merge from branch <b>
     has been done and everything cleaned up.

Current branches:
-----------------
  term_with_closure: initiated by Bruno Barras as an investigation
                     into representing substitutions as closures.
  parse: initiated by Michael Norrish as a reworking of the hol90
         parser.  Finished, and merged back into the main branch to
         start the Taupo series of releases.


Other tags:
-----------
  athabasca-4   - a semi-official release, used as the basis for much
                  of the first year's work on the Prosper project.
  now-need-mosml-144 - tag marking switch to MoscowML 1.44
  start - beginning of the repository, version slightly predating
          athabasca-4
