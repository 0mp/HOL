Brief notes on the directories in the HOL4 source repository, at

  https://hol.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/hol
------------------------------------------------------------------

HOL/
  The main-line (or "trunk") of HOL4 development.

tags/
  As with standard svn practice, this directory should be used to
  record snapshots of the development state.  After the first check-in
  establishing a snapshot, there should not be further check-ins to
  that sub-directory.

  RELEASES/
    Tags for public releases, identified by release name
    (<lake>-<number>).

  Old-CVS-tags/
    A number of old, mainly CVS-branching inspired tags.


branches/
  There are two sorts of branches here: those intended to support a
  long-term ongoing project (three examples as of September 2009:
  HOL-Omega, HOL-Check and other-languages), and those for work on
  something short-term (where work is expected to eventually finish).
  Short-term branches can probably be deleted: they either get merged
  into the main-line, or they expire because the experiment failed.

  Things other than those listed here are probably ancient "new
  feature" branches that were merged into the mainline.  (This is true
  of parse-branch and term_with_closure_branch.)

  release-development/
    This is a special case of a short-term branch, where the work is
    the final preparatory steps before a public release.  When the
    release is made, the snapshot copied to tags/RELEASES will be from
    here.  It's conceivable that a release could be made without
    needing to use a release-development branch.  If so, the trunk can
    just get copied.

    These branches probably shouldn't be deleted: one may wish to
    release patches against particular releases.

  HOL-Omega/
    Peter Homeier's HOL-Omega system.

  HOL-Check/
    Michael Norrish's "playing around with MLton" experiment

  other-languages/
    Versions of HOL in other languages.   The scheme work is the only
    thing here as of September 2009.

    scheme/

webpages/
  What appears on hol.sourceforge.net and code to support it.

  topublish/
    Exact copy of what is on the website

  tools/
    Code to support the generation of web-pages.
