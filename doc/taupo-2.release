Bugs fixed:
-----------
  * Automatic dependency analysis in Holmake could get confused (in
    the presence of unbalanced `` "tokens") and bail out without much
    in the way of an error message.  Fixed at least one instance of
    this problem.

New theories:
-------------
  * A theory of lazy lists
