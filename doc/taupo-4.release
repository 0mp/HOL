Bugs fixed:
-----------
  * The arithmetic decision procedure embedded in the simplifier was
    adding too much context in some cases, and thereby failing to
    prove goals that were really within its scope.

  * Restricted quantifiers with list literals in the restriction were
    failing to pretty-print.  This bug was actually fixed in time for
    Taupo-3, but wasn't mentioned in its release notes.
