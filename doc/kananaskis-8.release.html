<h1>Notes on HOL 4, Kananaskis-8 release</h1>

<p>We are pleased to announce the Kananaskis-8 release of HOL 4.</p>

<h2 id="new-features">New features:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The <code>Define</code> function for making function definitions now allows variables that appear as formal parameters to the new functions being defined to share names with existing constants.
This is based on the view that <code>`f x = x + 1`</code> should be the same as <code>`f = λx. x + 1`</code>.
In the latter, it was already permitted to use constant names in the position of the <code>x</code>, now it is permitted in the former as well.
There is one exception: if the formal name is the name of a constructor, then it has to be read as a constant rather than a bound name in order to allow ML-style pattern-matching.
So, the following now works:
<pre>
    &gt; Define`x = 1`;
    Definition has been stored under "x_def"
    val it = |- x = 1

    &gt; Define`f x = x + 1`;
    Definition has been stored under "f_def"
    val it = |- ∀x. f x = x + 1
</pre>
<p>But, this next session fails:
<pre>
    &gt; Hol_datatype`foo = X | Y`
    &lt;&lt;HOL Message: Defined type: "foo"&gt;&gt;
    val it = () : unit

    &gt; Define`g X = X + 1`;
    ...<i>&lt;Type inference failure&mdash;exception raised&gt;</i>...
</pre>
<p>Thanks to Scott Owens for the <a href="http://github.com/mn200/HOL/issues/17">feature suggestion</a>.

</ul>

<h2 id="bugs-fixed">Bugs fixed:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p> Declaring an “enumerated” data type (one with nullary constructors only) with certain choices of constructor names could lead to unloadable theories.
Thanks to Scott Owens for the <a href="https://github.com/mn200/HOL/issues/78">bug report</a>.

<li><p> Calling <code>delete_const</code> on a constant that had been defined with <code>Define</code> could lead to unloadable theories.
Thanks to Magnus Myreen and Ramana Kumar for help in finding and fixing  <a href="http://github.com/mn200/HOL/issues/73">this bug</a>.

</ul>

<h2 id="new-theories">New theories:</h2>

<ul>
<li> <p>The theory of sets has been extended with new <code>PROD_IMAGE</code> and <code>PROD_SET</code> constants, by analogy with existing <code>SUM_IMAGE</code> (also known as <code>SIGMA</code>) and <code>SUM_SET</code>.
The <code>PROD_IMAGE</code> constant is overloaded to <code>PI</code> and <code>Π</code>.
Thanks to Joseph Chan for this.

<li> <p> A small theory, <code>gcdset</code> defining a function <code>gcdset</code> that returns the greatest common divisor of any non-empty set of natural numbers (and returns 0 for the empty set for the sake of totality).
</ul>

<h2 id="new-tools">New tools:</h2>

<ul>



</ul>

<h2 id="new-examples">New examples:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>A development of the theory of ordinal numbers (in <code>examples/set-theory/hol_sets</code>, based on a quotient of well-orders.
Standard arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication and exponentiation) are defined, as well as the notion of supremum.
The theorem that all ordinals can be expressed in a polynomial form over all possible bases greater than 1 is also proved.
(When the base is <code>ω</code>, this gives the “Cantor Normal Form”.)
</ul>

<h2 id="incompatibilities">Incompatibilities:</h2>

<ul>

<li><p>The syntax for <code>case</code> expressions has changed to be the same as in SML. This means that instead of
<pre>
        case n of
           0 -> 1
        || SUC n -> n + 1
</pre>
<p>one should write
<pre>
        case n of
          0 => 1
        | SUC n => n + 1
</pre>
<p>Additionally, as an aid to uniformity, the first case may be preceded by a bar character.
This makes the following valid HOL (it is not valid SML):
<pre>
        case n of
        | 0 => 1
        | SUC n => n + 1
</pre>

<p>The new syntax does not mix well with the vertical bars of the set comprehension syntax.
If one has a case expression inside a set-comprehension, the parser will likely be confused unless the case expression is enclosed in parentheses.
The pretty-printer will parenthesise all case-expressions inside set comprehensions.

<p>The pretty-printer’s behaviour cannot be easily changed, but if one wishes to support source files using the old syntax, the following incantation can be used:
<pre>
        set_mapped_fixity {
          tok = "||", fixity = Infixr 6,
          term_name = GrammarSpecials.case_split_special
        };
        set_mapped_fixity {
          tok = "-&gt;", fixity = Infixr 10,
          term_name = GrammarSpecials.case_arrow_special
        };
</pre>
<p>The problem with using this old syntax is that the <code>||</code> token is now also used for the bit-wise or operation on words.
If <code>wordsLib</code> is loaded, the parser will behave unpredictably unless the new syntax for bitwise or is removed.
This removal can be done with:
<pre>
        remove_termtok {tok = "||", term_name = "||"}
</pre>
<p>When this is done, or if <code>wordsLib</code> is not loaded in the first place, old-style case-expressions will be parsed correctly.
</ul>
