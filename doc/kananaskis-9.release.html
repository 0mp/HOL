<ul>

<li><p>The case-constants generated for algebraic data types now have different types.
The value that is “switched on” is now the first argument of the constant rather than the last.
The names of these constants have also changed, emphasising the change.
For example, the old constant for natural numbers, <code>num_case</code> had type
<pre>
   α → (num → α) → num → α
</pre>
<p> Now the case constant for the natural numbers is called <code>num_CASE</code> and has type
<pre>
   num → α → (num → α) → α
</pre>

<p>This change is invisible if the “<code>case</code>-<code>of</code>” syntax is used.

<p>This change makes more efficient evaluation (with <code>EVAL</code>) of expressions with case constants possible.

<p>In addition, the <code>bool_case</code> constant has been deleted entirely: when the arguments are flipped as above it becomes identical to <code>COND</code> (<code>if</code>-<code>then</code>-<code>else</code>).
This means that simple case-expressions over booleans will print as <code>if</code>-<code>then</code>-<code>else</code> forms.
Thus
<pre>
   > ``case b of T => 1 | F => 3``;
   val it = ``if b then 1 else 3``: term
</pre>
<p>More complicated case expressions involving booleans will still print with the <code>case</code> form:
<pre>
   > ``case p of (x,T) => 3 | (y,F) => y``;
   val it =
     ``case p of (x,T) => 3 | (x,F) => x``: term
</pre>

<p>At the ML level, we have tried to retain a degree of backwards compatibility.
For example, the automatically defined case constants for algebraic types will still be saved in their home-theories with the name “<i>type</i><code>_case_def</code>”.
In addition, case terms for the core types of the system (options, lists, numbers, pairs, sums, etc) can still be constructed and destructed through functions in the relevant <i>type</i><code>Syntax</code> modules in the same way.
For example, <code>numSyntax.mk_num_case</code> still has the type
<pre>
   term * term * term -> term
</pre>
<p> and the returned term-triple still corresponds to the 0-case, the successor-case and the number-argument (in that order), as before.
This is despite the fact that the underlying term has those sub-terms in a different order (the number-argument comes first).
