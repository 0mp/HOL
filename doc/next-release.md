New features:

Bugs fixed:
-----------

- An embarrassing infinite loop bug in the integration of the integer decision procedures (the Omega test, Cooperâ€™s algorithm) into the simplifier was fixed.

New theories:
-------------

New tools:
----------

New examples:
---------

- A theory of balanced binary trees (`examples/balanced_bst`), based on Haskell code by Leijen and Palamarchuk, and mechanised by Scott Owens.  The type supports operations such as `insert`, `union`, `delete`, filters and folds.  Operations are parameterised by comparison operators for comparing keys.  Balanced trees can themselves be compared.

Incompatibilities:
