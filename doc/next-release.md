New theories:
-------------

*   `real_topologyTheory`: a rather complete theory of Elementary
    Topology in Euclidean Space, ported by Muhammad Qasim and Osman
    Hasan from HOL-light (up to 2015). The part of General Topology
    (independent of `realTheory`) is now available at
    `topologyTheory`; the old `topologyTheory` is renamed to
    `metricTheory`.

    There is a minor backwards-incompatibility: old proof scripts using
    the metric-related results in previous `topologyTheory` should now
    open `metricTheory` instead. (Thanks to Chun Tian for this work.)

New tools:
----------

New examples:

Incompatibilities:
------------------

*   The `Holmake` tool now behaves with the `--qof` behaviour enabled by default.
    This means that script files which have a tactic failure occur will cause the building of the corresponding theory to fail, rather than having the build continue with the theorem “cheated”.
    We think this will be less confusing for new users.
    Experts who *do* want to have script files continue past such errors can use the `--noqof` option to enable the old behaviour.

*   When running with Poly/ML, we now require at least version 5.7.0.
