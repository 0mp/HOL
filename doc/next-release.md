New features:
-------------

* Our TUTORIAL and LOGIC manuals are now available in Italian translations.  Many thanks to Domenico Masini for doing this work.

Bugs fixed:
-----------

* `Holmake` was unnecessarily quiet when it compiled certain SML files.

* The “munging” code for turning HOL into LaTeX now does a better job of rendering data type definition theorems.

* On Windows, the Unicode trace is now off by default.

New theories:
-------------

New tools:
----------

- New libraries `enumLib` and `fmapalLib` provide representations in `pred_set` and finite map types of enumerated constant sets and maps as minimum-depth binary search trees. A suitable total order on the set elements (map arguments) must be supplied, with a conversion for evaluating it; assistance with this is provided. The primary objective has been an `IN_CONV`, and a similar `FAPPLY_CONV`, operating with a logarithmic number of comparisons, but additional operations such as `UNION_CONV`, `INTER_CONV`, and `FUPDATE_CONV` are included and have reasonable asymptotic running times. A conversion `TC_CONV` implements Warshall’s algorithm for transitive closure of a binary relation (treated as a set-valued finite map).
