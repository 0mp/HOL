How to rewrite with a theorem the other way round?
  -- Use GSYM

What's with all this "cut looping" stuff?
  -- It's the simplifier, and it's turned off in Taupo releases
     onwards unless you set the trace level to one or higher.

How can I find out more information about a HOL_ERR <poly> exception?
  -- If expression e is causing the grief, then write
        (e) handle E => raise E
     (Often the parentheses around e will not be required.)

Are error messages during the build like the following a source for
concern?
