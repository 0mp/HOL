athabasca-4: (* tagged in the repository *)
   * "Norrish" numerals implemented.  These allow numerals in the
     logic to be arbitrarily large, with the various operations on
     them dramatically improved in efficiency.  (Standard arithmetic
     operations now take time that is polynomial in the number of
     digits rather than the size of the number.)

   * The build process has been made a great deal more independent of
     Unix, and it is possible to build hol98 on Windows NT.

taupo-0:  (* not released or tagged *)
   * New extensible parser implemented

taupo-1:
   * Overloaded operators implemented
   * TFL and bossLib completely redesigned.
