This sequence of directories reproduces a bug observed in CakeML.

The build sequence ensures that dir2 and dir1 are built before dir3,
which means that the --no_prereqs option in dir3 doesnâ€™t cause an
immediate failure.

The issue is that the .uo file for derivedTheory has to pick up a
reference to baseTheory, which lives in dir2, but the dependency
analysis that is done when --no_prereqs is in force may not get a
chance to see this.
