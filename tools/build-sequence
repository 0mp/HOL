# This file specifies the sequence of directories that the build
# program builds, after first building the kernel.  Each non-comment,
# non-blank line specifies a directory under the root HOL directory
# which will be visited by the build program.  Build is special-cased
# so that some directories are treated differently, but the default
# behaviour is that in each, it will call Holmake --qof.

# Comments can be added; all text on a line after a # symbol is
# ignored.  Similarly blank lines are ignored.  If you are going to
# edit this file, be aware that it does not record various
# dependencies between the directories.  If dir1 is earlier than dir2,
# then dir1 can not depend on dir2, but if dir1 is later than dir2,
# then it may or may not depend on dir2.

# these three directories are required to even run hol.bare.unquote
