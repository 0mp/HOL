# This file specifies the sequence of directories that the build
# program builds, after first building the kernel.  Each non-comment,
# non-blank line specifies a directory which will be visited by the
# build program.  Directories that are not absolute are interpreted
# with respect to the root of the HOL directory. Build is
# special-cased so that some directories are treated differently, but
# the default behaviour is that in each, it will call Holmake --qof.

# Comments can be added; all text on a line after a # symbol is
# ignored.  Similarly blank lines are ignored.  If you are going to
# edit this file, be aware that it does not record various
# dependencies between the directories.  If dir1 is earlier than dir2,
# then dir1 can not depend on dir2, but if dir1 is later than dir2,
# then it may or may not depend on dir2.

# If a directory name is preceded by an !, then it will only be built
# if the -selftest flag is passed to Holmake, and the object files
# that it builds will not be transferred to the sigobj directory.  If
# there is more than one ! then the number of them indicates the level
# of -selftest required in order to get that directory to be built at
# all.  (If -selftest appears on its own, then that's level 1.  If you
# write -selftest 2, that's level 2, which means directories with 2 !s
# will get tested.)

# If a directory name is preceded by a string inside []-brackets, then
# that directory/target will only be considered if the string is the
# name of the current ML implementation.  Thus the line [poly]foo
# will cause foo to be built only if the current implementation is
# Poly/ML.  (The other supported implementation at the time of writing
# is [mosml].)  If combining this with exclamation marks, the [system]
# annotation should come first, i.e., [mosml]!!foo, not !![mosml]foo.
