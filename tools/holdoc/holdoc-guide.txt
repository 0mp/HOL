Makefile magic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a model Makefile.  It arranges things so that

 - for HOL source to be processed by LTS, %Script.tex will
   automatically be built from %Script.sml.

 - for LaTeX source with embedded HOL to be processed by MNG,
   %.tex will automatically be built from %.mng.

 - %.dvi will be built from %.tex, and %.ps from %.dvi.

Also, munging errors will be written into the corresponding .errs
file, as well as being displayed on the console.

BE VERY CAREFUL TO LOOK AT THE ERRORS, because make won't
automatically detect them :-(.

Syntax
~~~~~~

There are two parsing modes, HOL and TeX.  You can switch between
them.  mng_to_latex starts in TeX mode, and lts_to_latex starts in HOL
mode.

In HOL mode, the parser parses identifiers,
newlines-with-indentation-following, white space, ordinary comments (*
stuff *), strings "string" (with no escapes, so you can't have a
double quote inside), HOLDoc directives (*[ DIRECTIVE arg arg arg ]*),
separators "~()[]{}.,", backticks, double backticks, and embedded TeX
(*: this\footnote{is embedded \TeX{} $e=mc^2$.}? :*).

In TeX mode, the parser parses HOLDoc directives (*[ DIRECTIVE arg arg
arg ]*) (which cannot be commented out by a TeX comment), embedded HOL
outside math mode [[this.is.HOL]], embedded HOL in math mode $
<[this.is.HOL]> \text{but this is not} $, and of course ordinary TeX
source.  There is an alternative syntax for directives: %(*[ DIRECTIVE
arg arg arg ]*), which is safer because it will be ignored by LaTeX if
it directly processes the file.


In HOL, there are multiple classes of identifier and symbol, each of
which may be typeset differently.  Typesetting is specified in
ltsmunge.sty, and the actual translation is specified mostly in the
relevant .imn file, although some is hardwired.  An unrecognised
identifier will be typeset in red, and its name will be printed to
stderr (with the model Makefile, this ends up in foo.errs).


Directives
~~~~~~~~~~

Unrecognised directives are ignored, so a directive can be commented
out by adding a "C" in front of it, and comments can be written as (*[
C this is a comment ]*) in Fortran style.  Directives are *completely
elided* from the output, so particularly, newlines inside directives
do not appear in the output.

If you want to specify a whole pile of directives at the top of a
file, you might rather put it in a .imn (include munge) file and cat
it onto the front of the file you are munging.  Blank lines are legal
syntax in TeX, so that's fine; they're also legal in SML.  The model
Makefile uses this trick.

The first directive is built into holdoc_munge.ml.

(*[ VARS x y z ]*) adds the named variables to the list of identifiers
that will be typeset as variables (rather than unknown).  Scope in LTS
mode is the entire current rule, and the directive is only processed
when it occurs in the list of vars after a binder such as !.  Scope in
MNG is the rest of the source file.

The rest of the directives are defined in holdoc_init.ml.

(*[ TYPE_LIST id id id *]) adds the named identifiers to the list of
"type" identifiers, typeset with \tstype{} except that that is
currently commented out.

(*[ CON_LIST id id id *]) adds the named identifiers to the list of
"constructor" identifiers, typeset with \tscon{}. [small caps]

(*[ FIELD_LIST id id id *]) adds the named identifiers to the list of
"field" identifiers, typeset with \tsvar{} at the moment just like
variables because field names are usually the default variable name
for that field.

(*[ LIB_LIST id id id *]) adds the named identifiers to the list of
"library call" identifiers, typeset with \tslib{}. [charter]

(*[ AUX_LIST id id id *]) adds the named identifiers to the list of
"auxiliary function" identifiers, typeset with \tsaux{}. [roman]

(*[ AUX_INFIX_LIST id id id *]) adds the named identifiers to the list
of "infix auxiliary function" identifiers, typeset with
\tsauxinfix{}. [roman, spacing]

(*[ VAR_PREFIX_LIST id id id *]) adds the named identifiers to the list
of variable prefixes; identifiers with these names or appended numbers
or primes will be typeset with \tsvar{}.  [italic]

(*[ HOL_OP_LIST id id id *]) adds the named identifiers to the list of
"HOL operators", typeset with \tsholop{}.  [bold lowercase]


(*[ HOL_SYM_ALIST ++ "\TeXery" ==> "\more\texery" *]) adds the named
symbols to the list of "HOL symbols", which are typeset with the
specified TeX, literally.  Since HOL strings have no escapes, you
don't need to escape the backslash, but you can't write a double
quote.

(*[ HOL_ID_ALIST id "\TeXery" id "\more\texery" *]) adds the named
identifiers to the list of "HOL identifiers", which are typeset with
the specified TeX, literally.  Since HOL strings have no escapes, you
don't need to escape the backslash, but you can't write a double
quote.

Note that in TeX, you should usually append a space, thus:

   (*[ HOL_SYM_ALIST --> "\longrightarrow " ]*)

in case the next character is not a backslash or other delimiter!

(*[ HOL_CURRIED_ALIST id "\TeXery" 2 true false id "\moreTexery" 3 false false ]*)
adds the named identifiers to the list of "curried HOL identifier",
which have the specified number of arguments, which are passed to the
specified TeX command.  If the first flag is true, commas within an argument
are converted to "}{", but the extra TeX args introduced this way do
not count towards the number specified in this directive.  An argument
is a (possibly qualified using dot notation) id, or a balanced-paren
subsequence.  If the first flag is true, the outer parentheses are stripped
if present.  If the second flag is true, multiple-line arguments are
permitted; if it is false, they are not.  The TeX command must be able
to handle linebreaks in its argument.  The second flag is *optional*
and defaults to false.


The last few are a bit different.

(*[ ECHO ]*) turns on echo mode *after the next token* (including
white space).

(*[ NOECHO ]*) turns off echo mode immediately.

These two are generally used around a .imn file, and avoid generating
extra blank lines around the file.  Unfortunately at the moment, the
last blank line in the file will unavoidably generate a blank line in
the output.

Note that ECHO / NOECHO are only respected in MNG mode.


(*[ RCSID "$Id$" ]*) records the given string as the RCS ID for the
file.  lts_to_latex uses this to define the command \rulesrcsid, which
can be useful to identify the version of munged rules.


(*[ INDENT ]*) turns on indent mode (this is on by default).  This
means that indentation (white space) at the beginning of a line will
be turned into some number of \quads, according to an appropriate
formula.  This takes effect immediately.

(*[ NOINDENT ]*) turns indent mode off.  Indentation (white space at
the beginning of a line) is ignored.  This takes effect immediately.


(*[ HOLDELIM "$" "$" ]*) redefines the strings substituted for the
enter-HOL-mode and exit-HOL-mode directives, [[ and ]].  These are
normally just "$" and "$", but can be changed, e.g., to colourise the
output of HOL strings.


One for MNG source:

%(*[ SHOWRULE select.4 ]*)

embeds the command \showrule{\selectXD} in the source at that point.
This is useful for including rules.  I've shown the TeX form of the
directive, but of course the leading % may be omitted.

Be warned, however, that whether it is introduced with % or not, the
remainder of the SHOWRULE line will be commented out in the generated
TeX!


Known bugs
~~~~~~~~~~

* a space is required between \[ and <[, because Keith didn't subtract
  his regular expressions correctly in Hollex.tnormal.  Assistance
  welcomed.


Wish list
~~~~~~~~~

- ability to typeset arbitrary HOL definition etc from files (name it,
  pick it out) (*[ BIND_TO_TEX foobar ]*) followed by the define.

- can we have field names in roman?  (anything preceding := or following . ?)
  (imagine the reader parsing the s's in sendto_4, eg)

- fancy typesetting for context conditions like F_context FC

- allow empty side conditions; don't force T.

- compute binders in set comprehension somehow (see note below).

- look at typeset version of [[ DRESTRICT fds (COMPL {fd}) ]].  The
  parens around [[ (COMPL {fd}) ]] are required for HOL, but if we use
  a symbol like \overline for [[COMPL]], they're not needed for the
  typeset output.  How can we smash them away?

- fix potential_vars so that it picks up all variables in a multi-line
  existential or universal, rather than just the first line.

- allow VAR_PREFIXes to optionally specify replacement TeX, eg

    G  "\Gamma"
    G'  "\Gamma'"
    G'' "\Gamma''"
    G''' "\Gamma'''"


- allow the addition of suffixes, eg 'k'.  (have it check for non-ambiguity?)

   nk "\tsvar{n}_k "
    ek "\tsvar{e}_k "
    xk "\tsvar{x}_k "
    hk "\tsvar{h}_k "

- have some mechanism for general sub/superscripting
