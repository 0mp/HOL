| HOL DISTRIBUTION DIRECTORY: Covers					|
+ ===================================================================== +



This directory contains the LaTeX source for the fancy cover pages for
the HOL manual.

These pages are full of PostScript inclusions, and are useless to you
if you don't have a PostScript printer.  The epsfig macros are also
required.

You may have to edit the definition of some variables in the Makefile
in this subdirectory (Covers) to make things work properly.

Once the above requirements have been met, simply typing "make" at the
Unix prompt should set things up.  You may then print the files
titlepages.ps and endpages.ps to your PostScript printer.

As usual, "make clean" is also provided.
