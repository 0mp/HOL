\chapter{Getting and Installing HOL}
\label{install}

This chapter describes how to get the \HOL{} system and how to install
it.  It is generally assumed that some sort of Unix system is being
used, but the instructions that follow should apply {\it mutatis
  mutandis\/} to other platforms.  Unix is not a pre-requisite for
using the system. \HOL{} may be run on PCs running Windows operating
systems from Windows~NT onwards (i.e., Windows~2000, XP and Vista are
also supported), as well as Macintoshes running MacOS~X.

\section{Getting HOL}

The \HOL{} system can be downloaded from
\url{http://hol.sourceforge.net}.  The naming scheme for \holn{}
releases is $\langle${\it name}$\rangle$-$\langle${\it
  number}$\rangle$; the release described here is \holnversion.

\section{The {\tt hol-info} mailing list}

The \texttt{hol-info} mailing list serves as a forum for discussing
\HOL{} and disseminating news about it.  If you wish to be on this
list (which is recommended for all users of \HOL), visit
\url{http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/hol-info}.  This
web-page can also be used to unsubscribe from the mailing list.

\section{Installing HOL}

It is assumed that the \HOL{} sources have been obtained and the
\texttt{tar} file unpacked into a directory \ml{hol}.\footnote{You may
  choose another name if you want; it is not important.} The contents
of this directory are likely to change over time, but it should
contain the following:


\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline
\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{ } \\
\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\bf Principal Files on the HOL Distribution Directory} \\
\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{ } \\
{\it File name} & {\it Description} & {\it File type}  \\ \hline
{\tt README} & Description of directory {\tt hol} & Text\\
{\tt COPYRIGHT}& A copyright notice & Text\\
{\tt install.txt} & Installation instructions & Text\\
{\tt tools} & Source code for building the system & Directory\\
{\tt bin} & Directory for HOL executables & Directory\\
{\tt sigobj} & Directory for \ML{} object files & Directory\\
{\tt src} & \ML{} sources of \HOL & Directory\\
{\tt help} & Help files for \HOL{} system & Directory\\
{\tt examples} & Example source files & Directory\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The session in the box below shows a typical distribution directory.
The \HOL{} distribution has been placed on a PC running Linux in the
directory {\small\tt /home/mn200/hol/}.

All sessions in this documentation will be displayed in boxes with a
number in the top right hand corner.  This number indicates whether
the session is a new one (when the number will be {\small\sl 1}) or
the continuation of a session started in an earlier box.
Consecutively numbered boxes are assumed to be part of a single
continuous session.  The Unix prompt for the sessions is
\texttt{\small \$}, so lines beginning with this prompt were typed by
the user.  After entering the \HOL{} system (see below), the user is
prompted with {\small\verb|-|} for an expression or command of the
\HOL{} meta-language \ML; lines beginning with this are thus \ML\
expressions or declarations.  Lines not beginning with \texttt{\small
  \$} or {\small\verb|-|} are system output.  Occasionally, system
output will be replaced with a line containing {\small\verb|...|} when
it is of minimal interest. The meta-language \ML{} is introduced in
Chapter~\ref{ML}.

\setcounter{sessioncount}{0}
\begin{session}
\begin{verbatim}
$ pwd
/home/mn200/hol
$ ls -F
COPYRIGHT  bin/  examples/  install.txt  src/
README     doc/  help/      sigobj/      tools/
\end{verbatim}
\end{session}

Now you will need to rebuild \HOL{} from the sources.\footnote{It is
  possible that pre-built systems may soon be available from the
  web-page mentioned above.}

Before beginning you must have a current version of Moscow~ML.  In
particular, you must have version 2.01.  Moscow~ML is available on the
web from \url{http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~sestoft/mosml.html}.
When you have \texttt{mosml} installed, and are in the root directory
of the distribution, the next step is to run \texttt{smart-configure}:

\begin{session}
\begin{alltt}
\$ mosml < tools/smart-configure.sml
Moscow ML version 2.01 (January 2004)
Enter `quit();' to quit.
- [opening file "tools/smart-configure-mosml.sml"]

HOL smart configuration.

Determining configuration parameters: OS mosmldir holdir
OS:                 linux
mosmldir:           /home/mn200/mosml/bin
holdir:             /home/mn200/hol
dynlib_available:   true

Configuration will begin with above values.  If they are wrong
press Control-C.
\end{alltt}
\end{session}

Assuming you don't interrupt the configuration process, this will
build the \texttt{Holmake} and \texttt{build} programs, and move them
into the \texttt{hol/bin} directory.  If something goes wrong at this
stage, consult Section~\ref{sec:editting-configure} below.

The next step is to run the \texttt{build} program.  This should
result in a great deal of output as all of the system code is compiled
and the theories built.  Eventually, a \HOL{} system\footnote{Four
  \HOL{} executables are produced: \textsf{hol}, \textsf{hol.noquote},
  \textsf{hol.bare} and \textsf{hol.bare.noquote}.  The first of these
  will be used for most examples in the \TUTORIAL{}.} is produced in
the \texttt{bin/} directory.

\begin{session}
\begin{verbatim}
$ bin/build
  ...
  ...
Uploading files to /home/mn200/hol/sigobj

Hol built successfully.
$
\end{verbatim}
\end{session}


\subsection{Overriding \texttt{smart-configure}}
\label{sec:editting-configure}

If \texttt{smart-configure} is unable to guess correct values for the
four parameters, \texttt{mosmldir}, \texttt{holdir}. \texttt{OS} and
\texttt{dynlib\_available} then you can create a file called
\texttt{config-override} in the root directory of the HOL
distribution.  In this file, specify the correct value for the
appropriate parameter by providing an ML binding for it.  Each of the
first three variables must be given a string as a possible value,
while \texttt{dynlib\_available} must be either \texttt{true} or
\texttt{false}.  So, one might write

\begin{session}
\begin{verbatim}
val OS = "unix";
val holdir = "/local/scratch/myholdir";
val dynlib_available = false;
\end{verbatim}
\end{session}

The \texttt{config-override} file need only provide values for those
variables that need overriding.

With this file in place, the \texttt{smart-configure} program will use
the values specified there rather than those it attempts to calculate
itself.  The value given for the \texttt{OS} variable must be one of
\texttt{"unix"}, \texttt{"linux"}, \texttt{"solaris"},
\texttt{"macosx"} or \texttt{"winNT"}.\footnote{The string
  \texttt{"winNT"} is used for Microsoft Windows operating systems
  that are at least as recent as Windows~NT.  This includes
  Windows~2000, XP and Vista.}

In extreme circumstances it is possible to edit the file
\texttt{configure.sml} yourself to set configuration variables
directly.  At the top of this file three SML declarations are present,
but commented out.  You will need to uncomment this section (remove
the \texttt{(*} and \texttt{*)} markers), and provide sensible values.
The \texttt{mosmldir} value must be the name of the directory
containing the Moscow~ML binaries (\texttt{mosmlc}, \texttt{mosml},
\texttt{mosmllex} etc).  The \texttt{holdir} value must be the name of
the top-level directory listed in the first session above.  The
\texttt{OS} value should be one of the strings specified in the
accompanying comment.  All three strings must be enclosed in double
quotes.

The next two values (\texttt{CC} and \texttt{GNUMAKE}) are needed for
``optional'' components of the system.  The first gives a string
suitable for invoking the system's C compiler, and the second
specifies a \textsf{make} program.

After editing, \texttt{tools/configure.sml} the lines above will look
something like:

\begin{session}
\begin{verbatim}
$ more configure.sml
  ...
val mosmldir = "/home/mn200/mosml";
val holdir   = "/home/mn200/hol";
val OS       = "linux"       (* Operating system; choices are:
                                "linux", "solaris", "unix", "winNT" *)

val CC       = "gcc";     (* C compiler (for building quote filter)        *)
val GNUMAKE  = "gnumake"; (* for robdd library                             *)
  ...
$
\end{verbatim}
\end{session}

\noindent Now, at either this level (in the \texttt{tools} directory)
or at the level above, the script \texttt{configure.sml} must be piped
into the Moscow~ML interpreter (called \texttt{mosml}).

\begin{session}
\begin{verbatim}
$ mosml < tools/configure.sml
Moscow ML version 2.01 (January 2004)
Enter `quit();' to quit.
- > val mosmldir = "/home/mn200/mosml" : string
  val holdir = "/home/mn200/hol" : string
  val OS = "linux" : string
- > val CC = "gcc" : string
  ...

\end{session}
