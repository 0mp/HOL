\label{chap:more-examples}

In addition to the examples already covered in this text, the \holn{}
distribution comes with a variety of instructive examples in the
\verb|examples| directory.  There the following examples (among
others) are to be found:

\begin{description}

\item [\tt autopilot.sml]

  This example is a \holn{} rendition (by Mark Staples) of a PVS
  example due to Ricky Butler of NASA. The example shows the use of
  the record-definition package, as well as illustrating some aspects
  of the automation available in \holn{}.

\item [\tt bmark]

  In this directory, there is a standard HOL benchmark: the proof of
  correctness of a multiplier circuit, due to Mike Gordon.

\item [\tt euclid.sml]

  This example is the same as that covered in
  chapter~\ref{chap:euclid}: a proof of Euclid's theorem on the
  infinitude of the prime numbers, extracted and modified from a much
  larger development due to John Harrison. It illustrates the
  automation of \HOL{} on a classic proof.

\item[\tt ind\_def]

This directory contains some examples of an inductive definition package
in action. Featured are an operational semantics for a small imperative
programming language, a small process algebra, and combinatory logic
with its type system. The files were originally developed by Tom Melham
and Juanito Camilleri and are extensively commented.

Most of the proofs in these theories can now be done much more easily by
using some of the recently developed proof tools, namely the simplifier
and the first order prover.

\item [\tt fol.sml]

  This file illustrates John Harrison's implementation of a
  model-elimination style first order prover.

\item[\tt lambda]

This directory develops theories of a "de Bruijn" style lambda calculus,
and also a name-carrying version. (Both are untyped.) The development
is a revision of the proofs underlying the paper
{\it "5 Axioms of Alpha Conversion",
            Andy Gordon and Tom Melham,
            Proceedings of TPHOLs'96, Springer LNCS 1125}.

\item[\tt parity]

  This sub-directory contains the files used in the parity example of
  chapter~\ref{parity}.

\item [\tt MLsyntax]

  This sub-directory contains an extended example of a facility for
  defining mutually recursive types, due to Elsa Gunter of Bell Labs.
  In the example, the type of abstract syntax for a small but not
  totally unrealistic subset of ML is defined, along with a simple
  mutually recursive function over the syntax.

\item[\tt Thery.sml]

  A very short example due to Laurent Thery, demonstrating a cute
  inductive proof.

\item[\tt RSA]

       This directory develops some of the mathematics underlying
       the RSA cryptography scheme. The theories have been 
       produced by Laurent Thery of INRIA Sophia-Antipolis.
