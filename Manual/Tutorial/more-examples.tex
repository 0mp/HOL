\label{chap:more-examples}

In addition to the examples already covered in this text, the \holn{}
distribution comes with a variety of instructive examples in the
\verb|examples| directory.  There the following examples (among
others) are to be found:

\begin{description}

\item [\tt autopilot.sml]

  This example is a \holn{} rendition (by Mark Staples) of a PVS
  example due to Ricky Butler of NASA. The example shows the use of
  the record-definition package, as well as illustrating some aspects
  of the automation available in \holn{}.

\item [\tt bmark]

  In this directory, there is a standard HOL benchmark: the proof of
  correctness of a multiplier circuit, due to Mike Gordon.

\item [\tt euclid.sml]

  This example is the same as that covered in
  chapter~\ref{chap:euclid}: a proof of Euclid's theorem on the
  infinitude of the prime numbers, extracted and modified from a much
  larger development due to John Harrison. It illustrates the
  automation of \HOL{} on a classic proof.

\item [\tt fol.sml]

  This file illustrates John Harrison's implementation of a
  model-elimination style first order prover.

\item [\tt MLsyntax]

  This sub-directory contains an extended example of a facility for
  defining mutually recursive types, due to Elsa Gunter of Bell Labs.
  In the example, the type of abstract syntax for a small but not
  totally unrealistic subset of ML is defined, along with a simple
  mutually recursive function over the syntax.

\item[\tt parity]

  This sub-directory contains the files used in the parity example of
  chapter~\ref{parity}.

\item[\tt Thery.sml]

  A very short example due to Laurent Thery, demonstrating a cute
  inductive proof.
