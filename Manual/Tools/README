# The `polyscripter` Tool

The `polyscripter` tool is a Unix filter program that passes most input lines unchanged, but looks out for those lines beginning with `>>` characters.
If it sees one such, it executes the Poly/ML compiler on that line, captures the result and then emits the input and the response to standard out.

## Inline Options

- The usual `>>` command gets the input after this prompt read until the next line that begins with a non-space character.
- The `>>_` command gets the compiler to act on the accompanying input, and this input is printed out, but the output is elided

## Command-line Options

-   If `polyscripter` is passed a filename as its first argument, this file is read, and treated as a dictionary mapping single (UTF8) characters to replacement strings (with character separated from mapping by whitespace).
    This mapping is applied to user-input strings (after the `>>`) and to compiler output as well.
    An example mapping would include lines such as

           ∀ \(\forall\)
           ∧ \(\land\)

    A mapping for LaTeX `alltt` type environments should also handle backslash and brace characters.
