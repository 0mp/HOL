This is the examples directory for Hol98.

Currently on offer are the following:

  * MLSyntax

       This example shows the use of a facility for defining mutually
       recursive types, due to Elsa Gunter of Bell Labs. In the example,
       the type of abstract syntax for a small but not totally
       unrealistic subset of ML is defined, along with a simple mutually
       recursive function over the syntax.


  * autopilot.sml

       This example is a Hol98 rendition of a PVS example due to Ricky
       Butler of NASA. The example shows the use of a record-definition
       package due to Mike Norrish and Phil Windley, as well as
       illustrating some aspects of the automation available in Hol98.


  * bmark

       This example is an old and standard HOL benchmark: the proof of
       correctness of a multiplier circuit, due to Mike Gordon.


  * euclid.sml

       This example is a proof of Euclid's theorem on the infinitude of
       the prime numbers. It has been extracted and modified by Konrad
       Slind from a much larger development originally due to John 
       Harrison.


  * fol.sml

      This file exercises John Harrison's implementation of a
      model-elimination style first order prover. 

  * ind_def

      This directory contains some examples of Tom Melham's inductive
      definition package in action. Featured are an operational
      semantics for a small imperative programming language, a small
      process algebra, and combinatory logic with its type system. The
      files are extensively commented.  NB. most of the proofs in these
      theories can now be done much more easily by using some of the
      recently developed tools, namely the simplifier and the first
      order prover.

  * taut.sml

      This file presents some tautologies, and uses an ML binding of
      J"orn Lind's ROBDD (Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagram) package 
      to attempt to prove them.

  * tempScript.sml

      This file is a template for making a separately compilable HOL
      theory script.
