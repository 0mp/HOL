This is the examples directory for Hol98.

Currently here are the following:

  * MLSyntax

       This example shows the use of a facility for defining 
       recursive types, implemented by John Harrison. In the example,
       the type of abstract syntax for a small but not totally
       unrealistic subset of ML is defined, along with a simple mutually
       recursive function over the syntax.

  * RSA

       This directory develops some of the mathematics underlying
       the RSA cryptography scheme. The theories have been 
       produced by Laurent Thery of INRIA Sophia-Antipolis.

  * autopilot.sml

       This example is a Hol98 rendition of a PVS example due to Ricky
       Butler of NASA. The example shows the use of a record-definition
       package due to Mike Norrish and Phil Windley, as well as
       illustrating some aspects of the automation available in Hol98.

  * bmark

       This example is an old and standard HOL benchmark: the proof of
       correctness of a multiplier circuit, due to Mike Gordon.

  * euclid.sml

       This example is a proof of Euclid's theorem on the infinitude of
       the prime numbers. It has been extracted and modified by Konrad
       Slind from a much larger development originally due to John 
       Harrison.

  * fol.sml

       This file exercises John Harrison's implementation of a
       model-elimination style first order prover. 

  * ind_def

       This directory contains some examples of Tom Melham's inductive
       definition package in action. Featured are an operational
       semantics for a small imperative programming language, a small
       process algebra, and combinatory logic with its type system. The
       files are extensively commented.  

  * lambda

       This directory develops a "de Bruijn" style lambda calculus, and
       also a name-carrying version. (Both are untyped.) The development
       is a revision of the proofs underlying the paper

           "5 Axioms of Alpha Conversion",
            Andy Gordon and Tom Melham,
            Proceedings of TPHOLs'96, Springer LNCS 1125.

  * root2.sml

       An adaptation of a proof by John Harrison that the square 
       root of two is not rational.

  * sunrise 

       This directory provides a very thorough implementation of 
       Hoare logic for a simple imperative language with mutually 
       recursive procedures. Verification condition generators are 
       supplied (and proved correct in HOL). The development includes 
       illustrative examples and documentation. Author: Peter Homeier.

  * taut.sml

       This file presents some tautologies, and uses an ML binding of 
       J"orn Lind's ROBDD (Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagram) package 
       to attempt to prove them.

  * tempScript.sml

       This file is a template for making a separately compilable HOL
       theory script.

  * Thery

       This file is a very simple introductory example of proof in HOL,
       extracted from 

         "A quick overview of PVS and HOL"

       by Laurent Thery of INRIA, Sophia-Antipolis, which was presented 
       at
     
         "Types summer school'99: Theory and practice of formal proofs",
         Giens, France, August 30 - September 10, 1999.
