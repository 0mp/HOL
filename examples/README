This is the examples directory for Hol98.

Currently on offer are the following:

  * MLSyntax

       This example shows the use of a facility for defining mutually
       recursive types, due to Elsa Gunter of Bell Labs. In the example,
       the type of abstract syntax for a small but not totally
       unrealistic subset of ML is defined, along with a simple mutually
       recursive function over the syntax.

  * RSA

       This directory develops some of the mathematics underlying
       the RSA cryptography scheme. The theories have been 
       produced by Laurent Thery of INRIA Sophia-Antipolis.

  * autopilot.sml

       This example is a Hol98 rendition of a PVS example due to Ricky
       Butler of NASA. The example shows the use of a record-definition
       package due to Mike Norrish and Phil Windley, as well as
       illustrating some aspects of the automation available in Hol98.

  * bmark

       This example is an old and standard HOL benchmark: the proof of
       correctness of a multiplier circuit, due to Mike Gordon.

  * euclid.sml

       This example is a proof of Euclid's theorem on the infinitude of
       the prime numbers. It has been extracted and modified by Konrad
       Slind from a much larger development originally due to John 
       Harrison.

  * fol.sml

       This file exercises John Harrison's implementation of a
       model-elimination style first order prover. 

  * ind_def

       This directory contains some examples of Tom Melham's inductive
       definition package in action. Featured are an operational
       semantics for a small imperative programming language, a small
       process algebra, and combinatory logic with its type system. The
       files are extensively commented.  

       NB. Most of the proofs in these theories can now be done much more
       easily by using some of the recently developed proof tools, 
       namely the simplifier and the first order prover.  

  * lambda

       This directory develops a "de Bruijn" style lambda calculus, and
       also a name-carrying version. (Both are untyped.) The development
       is a revision of the proofs underlying the paper

           "5 Axioms of Alpha Conversion",
            Andy Gordon and Tom Melham,
            Proceedings of TPHOLs'96, Springer LNCS 1125.

  * taut.sml

       This file presents some tautologies, and uses an ML binding of 
       J"orn Lind's ROBDD (Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagram) package 
       to attempt to prove them.

  * tempScript.sml

       This file is a template for making a separately compilable HOL
       theory script.

  * Thery

       This file is a very simple introductory example of proof in HOL,
       extracted from 

         "A quick overview of PVS and HOL"

       by Laurent Thery of INRIA, Sophia-Antipolis, which was presented 
       at
     
         "Types summer school'99: Theory and practice of formal proofs",
         Giens, France, August 30 - September 10, 1999.
