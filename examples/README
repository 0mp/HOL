This is the examples directory.

Currently here are the following:

  * MLSyntax

       This example shows the use of a facility for defining 
       recursive types, implemented by John Harrison. In the example,
       due to Elsa Gunter, the abstract syntax for a small but not 
       totally unrealistic subset of ML is defined, along with a simple
       mutually recursive function over the syntax.

  * RSA

       This directory develops some of the mathematics underlying
       the RSA cryptography scheme. The theories have been 
       produced by Laurent Thery of INRIA Sophia-Antipolis.

  * Rijndael

       This directory holds a formalization of Rijmen and Daemen's
       AES crypto standard, together with a proof of correctness.
       
  * Sugar2

       This directory contains a deep embedding of the Accellera 
       standard property language Sugar 2.0. Author: Mike Gordon.

  * arm6

       This directory contains a formal model of the ARM 
       (Acorn Risc Machine), version 6, along with a proof of 
       correctness. The specifications and proofs are due to Anthony Fox,
       and arise from a collaboration between Cambridge, Leeds, and ARM.
  
  * autopilot.sml

       This example is a rendition of a PVS example due to Ricky
       Butler of NASA. The example shows the use of a record-definition
       package due to Mike Norrish and Phil Windley, as well as
       illustrating some aspects of the automation currently available 
       in HOL.

  * bmark

       This example is an old and standard HOL benchmark: the proof of
       correctness of a multiplier circuit, due to Mike Gordon.

  * euclid.sml

       This example is a proof of Euclid's theorem on the infinitude of
       the prime numbers. It has been extracted and modified by Konrad
       Slind from a much larger development originally due to John 
       Harrison.

  * fol.sml

       This file exercises John Harrison's implementation of a
       model-elimination style first order prover. 

  * ind_def

       This directory contains some examples of Tom Melham's inductive
       definition package in action. Featured are an operational
       semantics for a small imperative programming language, a small
       process algebra, and combinatory logic with its type system. The
       files are extensively commented.  

  * lambda

       This directory develops a "de Bruijn" style lambda calculus, and
       also a name-carrying version. (Both are untyped.) The development
       is a revision of the proofs underlying the paper

           "5 Axioms of Alpha Conversion",
            Andy Gordon and Tom Melham,
            Proceedings of TPHOLs'96, Springer LNCS 1125.

  * miller

       This example is a verification of the Miller-Rabin
       probabilistic primality test, incorporating version 2 of
       probability theory and some cute example probabilistic
       programs. Author: Joe Hurd.

  * ring.sml

       Application of normalization and decision procedures for rings.
       Author: Bruno Barras.

  * root2.sml

       A proof that the square root of two is not rational. Adapted
       from a proof by John Harrison.

  * sunrise 

       This directory provides a very thorough implementation of 
       Hoare logic for a simple imperative language with mutually 
       recursive procedures. Verification condition generators are 
       supplied (and proved correct in HOL). The development includes 
       illustrative examples and documentation. Author: Peter Homeier.

  * taut.sml

       This file presents some tautologies, and uses an ML binding of 
       J"orn Lind's ROBDD (Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagram) package 
       to attempt to prove them.

  * tempScript.sml

       This file is a template for making a separately compilable HOL
       theory script.

  * Thery

       This file is a very simple introductory example of proof in HOL,
       extracted from 

         "A quick overview of PVS and HOL"

       by Laurent Thery of INRIA, Sophia-Antipolis, which was presented 
       at
     
         "Types summer school'99: Theory and practice of formal proofs",
         Giens, France, August 30 - September 10, 1999.
