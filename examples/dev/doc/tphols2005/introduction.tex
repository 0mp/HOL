We describe correct-by-construction compilation of
function definitions in higher order logic to hardware.  
The key idea of our approach is to automatically prove theorems of the
form $\vdash {\it{Imp}}\Longrightarrow\DEF{Dev}~f$, where
{\it{Imp}} is a term describing a circuit, $\DEF{Dev}~f$ specifies
that function $f$ is computed by a four-phase handshake and the
operator $\Longrightarrow$ means that the implementation meets the
specification.  Several different representations of implementations
are created, with the lowest level corresponding to
synthesisable Verilog.


Our system is implemented in HOL4, but the ideas could be
realised in other programmable higher order logic proof systems like
Isabelle, PVS, NuPrl and Coq. In such systems, functions are defined
recursively and then proof scripts are executed to prove properties of
the functions.  Proof scripts are programs that perform sequences of
deductions to create theorems.

In the next section we give a quick overview of the currently
implemented system using a simple (but unrealistic) example. We then
describe the specification of components in higher order logic that
underlies the work. Next we describe how function definitions in
higher order logic are translated to hardware via a sequence of steps,
ending with Verilog.  Some unfinished case studies that are in
progress are then discussed. Finally, we survey related work by
others, and outline our plans for the future. An appendix contains the
definitions of the circuit constructors that we use to build
implementations.
