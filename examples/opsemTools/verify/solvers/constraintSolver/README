This directory contains the following:

execSymb.sml .......... To verify a RSPEC as defined in newOpsemTheory 
             .......... using symbolic execution and an external constraint
             .......... constraint solver


extSolv.sml ........... to call the external solver as an oracle


term2xml.sml .......... to generate an xml tree from an HOL term
             .......... xml trees follow the grammar defined in
             .......... xmlterm2csp/xml/term.dtd  
                          

xmlterm2csp ........... Java classes that take an xml tree that represents
            ........... an HOL term and call a constraint solver 
            ........... to find a solution. 


NOTA:
  Current version of term2xml and xmlterm2csp requires  
  a local copy of the library jsolver4verif (jsolver.jar file). 
  The environment variable ILOG_EXEC must points to
  this local copy.

  jsolver4verif is proprietary of ILOG (see www.ilog.com).
  It is part of ILOG Business Rules Management Systems.
  jsolver4verif has been loaned for research purposes as part 
  of a collaboration between Ilog and CeP team, I3S laboratory, 
  University of Nice Sophia Antipolis.
