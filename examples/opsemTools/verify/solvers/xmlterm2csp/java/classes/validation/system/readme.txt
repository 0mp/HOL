package to represent validation systems.

The system contains a set of constraints that corresponds
to a HOL term "tm". 
Searching a solution of the system amount to show that 
   exist tm
as a solution
where "exist tm" is the existential closur of term tm.

A TermCSP contains a block of variables and a block 
of constraints.
