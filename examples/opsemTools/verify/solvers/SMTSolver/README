This directory contains the following:

execSymbSMT.sml .......... To verify a RSPEC as defined in newOpsemTheory 
                .......... using symbolic execution and an external constraint
                .......... SMT solver. 
                .......... SMT solver is used both for pruning paths
                .......... and for verifying the postcondition
                .......... at the end of the paths


extSMTSolver.sml ........... to call the external SMT solver as an oracle


term2yices.sml .......... to generate a .ys file that follows 
               .......... the yices input syntax from an HOL term
                          

yicesFiles     .......... generated yices files and result files of 


NOTA:
   Current version uses SMT solver yices.
   The binary file of yices can be downloaded from :
   http://yices.csl.sri.com/

   To do symbolice excution, you need to define the environment 
   variable YICES_EXEC that points to this yices binary file.
