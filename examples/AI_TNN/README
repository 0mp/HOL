Below are instructions for the experiments accompanying the paper
Tree Neural Networks in HOL4.
The implementation of Tree Neural Networks (TNN) can be found under the src/AI/machine_learning directory.

First, install PolyML and install HOL (see HOL/INSTALL file).
Then, in the examples/TNN_tasks directory (this directory) run:
- Holmake

In the same directory, launch an interactive session by calling:
- rlwrap ../../bin/hol (or just ../../bin/hol).

To train and test the TNN on the arithmetic datasets 
(copied from github address) run the following interactive commands:
 
- load "mleArith"; open mleArith;
- val tnn = train_fixed ();
- val r = test_fixed tnn;


rename data to data_entail.
