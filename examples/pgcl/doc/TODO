To Do List
----------

Partially Ordered Sets:

Positive Numbers:

Expectations:
- Develop theory of 1-bounded expectation for qtlTheory

WP:
- Remove the Assert command, instead Define `Assert p c = c`
- Theorems connecting wlp and wp
  - Perhaps via expect_lfp t = expect_gfp t?
- Derived commands to model concurrency using nondeterminism

Temporal Logic:
- Get it working with positive reals and 1-bounded expectations
- Verify random walker

Example Verifications:
- Random walk
- n-location rendezvous problem (strat n "i") a derived command
- Miller-Rabin
