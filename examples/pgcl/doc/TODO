To Do List
----------

Partially Ordered Sets:

Positive Numbers:

Expectations:
- Develop theory of 1-bounded expectation for qtlTheory

WP:
- Theorems connecting wlp and wp
  - Lemma: wlp prog p = 1 - awp prog (1 - p)      [for 1-bounded p]
  - Theorem: Leq (Conj (wlp prog p) (wp prog q)) (wp prog (Conj p q))
  - Corollary: Leq I (wp body I) ==> Leq (Conj I (wp loop One)) (wp loop I)
- Derived commands to model concurrency using nondeterminism

Temporal Logic:
- Get qtlTheory working with positive reals and 1-bounded expectations
- Verify random walker

Example Verifications:
- Random walk
- n-location rendezvous problem (strat n "i") a derived command
- Miller-Rabin
