This directory contains a deep embedding of the Accellera standard
property language Sugar 2.0 in HOL. The official documentation is at

 http://www.haifa.il.ibm.com/projects/verification/sugar/literature.html

Note that as a result of trying to prove some `sanity checking'
properties, bugs were found in the version of the HOL semantics
corresponding to the Accellera submission.  The current semantics has
been modified and now passes the initial `sanity checks' (see
PathScript.sml). 

Until confirmation that the changes I've made are correct has been
given by the Sugar authorities, the semantics should be regarded as
provisional. Also, further checking might reveal more bugs.

The contents of this directory are
