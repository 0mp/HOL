This directory contains a deep embedding of the Accellera standard
property language Sugar 2.0 in HOL. The official documentation is at

 http://www.haifa.il.ibm.com/projects/verification/sugar/literature.html

Note that as a result of trying to prove some "sanity checking"
properties, bugs have been found in the current version of the HOL
semantics (reflecting bugs in the Accellera submission).  The
semantics will be updated as soon as these bugs are fixed, but until
this is done the semantics should be regarded as flawed (in particular
the current version has some known-to-be-wrong parts that were added
to help some interim checks go through).

The contents of this directory are

Manual ..................... Directory containing a paper on the semantics
PathScript.sml ............. Theory of finite and infinite paths
README ..................... This file
Sugar2Script.sml ........... Start at proving some results about the semantics
Sugar2SemanticsScript.sml .. The semantics in HOL
