As a result of trying to prove some `sanity checking' properties, bugs
were found in the HOL semantics.  Although the current semantics has
been modified to correct all known bugs, the semantics is still
evolving and should be regarded as provisional.  The current draft
documentation is at

 http://www.eda.org/vfv/docs/formal_semantics_standalone.pdf

This semantics has evolved considerably from the original one
submitted to Accellera and appearing in the LRM. The changes, which
make Sugar closer to ForSpec, has resulted in a much simpler
semantics, and many proofs are now much shorter than before.

The last round of analysis using HOL revealed two problems.

1. The rewrite and direct semantics differed for "f abort b".
   This was fixed by restricting the requirement that the 
   two semantics agree to hold only for paths which the 
   current clock is true in the initial state.

2. The clocked and unclocked semantics of suffix implications {r}(f)
   were incompatible. This was fixed by changing the clocked semantics.
