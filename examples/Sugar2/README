This directory contains a deep embedding of the Accellera standard
property language Sugar 2.0 in HOL. The official documentation is at

 http://www.haifa.il.ibm.com/projects/verification/sugar/literature.html

Note that as a result of trying to prove some `sanity checking'
properties, bugs were found in the version of the HOL semantics
corresponding to the Accellera submission.  The current semantics has
been modified and now passes the initial `sanity checks' (see
PathScript.sml). However, it has one seriously unsatisfactory feature
needed to get the proofs to go through: namely:

  (F_SEM M p (STRONG_CLOCK c) (F_NOT f) =
    ~(F_SEM M p (STRONG_CLOCK c) f))

This is wrong (the occurrence of STRONG_CLOCK on the RHS
would be WEAK_CLOCK).

Until this is sorted out and confirmation that the other changes are
correct has been given, the semantics should be regarded as flwed and
provisional. Also, further checking might reveal more bugs.
