This directory contains a deep embedding of the Accellera standard
property language Sugar 2.0 in HOL. The official documentation is at

 http://www.haifa.il.ibm.com/projects/verification/sugar/literature.html

As a result of trying to prove some `sanity checking' properties, bugs
were found in the version of the HOL semantics corresponding to the
Accellera submission.  Although the current semantics has been
modified to correct the first batch of bugs, the semantics should be
regarded as provisional. For the latest work-in-progress version see:

 http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mjcg/Sugar/

The contents of this directory are

Manual ..................... Directory containing a paper on the semantics
PathScript.sml ............. Theory of finite and infinite paths
README ..................... This file
Sugar2Script.sml ........... Start at proving some results about the semantics
