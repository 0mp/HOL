This directory contains a deep embedding of the Accellera standard
property language Sugar 2.0 in HOL. The official documentation is at

 http://www.haifa.il.ibm.com/projects/verification/sugar/literature.html

Note that as a result of trying to prove some `sanity checking'
properties, bugs were found in the version of the HOL semantics
corresponding to the Accellera submission.  The current semantics has
been modified and now passes the initial `sanity checks' (see
PathScript.sml). However, the proofs about FL formulas have a
seriously unsatisfactory feature: to get them to go through I have had
to screen out negation formulas, as the induction bombs on them for
reasons I don't understand.

Until this is sorted out and confirmation that the changes I've made
are correct has been given, the semantics should be regarded as
provisional. Also, further checking might reveal more bugs.
