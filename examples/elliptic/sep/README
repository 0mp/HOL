 Summary
---------

 These theories adapt separation logic to reason about machine code. The 
 main difference between separation logic and these theories is the 
 separating conjunction: it is used here to separate any state elements 
 rather than only portions of the heap. The separating conjunction * is 
 handy in HOL since it can be used to avoid unintended aliasing, e.g. the 
 precondition "R a x * R b y" (register a has value x and register b has 
 value y) implies "~(a = b)".

 set_sepTheory

   Defines two separating conjunctions STAR and BIGSTAR over sets. STAR, 
   frequently written *, is a binary separating conjunction. BIGSTAR is 
   applied to a set and is informally described best as a star combination 
   of all the elements in the set:

     BIGSTAR {P1,...,Pn} = P1 * ... * Pn   whenever P1...Pn are distinct 

 set_sepLib

   Provides simpsets sep_ss and sep2_ss that simplifies expressions 
   containing STAR. sep_ss makes light simplifications. sep2_ss makes 
   harsher simplifications. sep2_ss pulls out the existential quantifiers 
   and pushes the "cond" terms to the right of the expression. 

   This library also defines conversions, rules and tactics for rearranging 
   terms containing STAR: MOVE_STAR_TAC, ASM_MOVE_STAR_TAC etc.

 progTheory

   Defines high-level Hoare-triples for reasoning about machine-code.
   The main definitions are RUN, GPROG, PROG and PROC. RUN is a basic
   separation logic inspired execution judgment, GPROG is a general 
   multi-entry, multi-exit and multi-code segment Hoare triple for machine 
   code. PROG is a common special case of GPROG. PROC is a procedure 
   specification.

 arm_progTheory

   Specialises progTheory to Anthony Fox's model of the ARM processor. 
   The specialization is done via a translation function arm2set. 
   The theory defines ARM_RUN, ARM_GPROG, ARM_PROG and ARN_PROC. 

   Handy theorems: ARM_RUN_SEMANTICS and ARM_PROG_INTRO1.

 arm_instTheory

   Provides ARM_PROG specifications for most ARM instructions.

 examplesTheory

   Proves a few example implementations. Currently: FAC, GCD and SUM_BTREE.
