 Quick overview
----------------

 set_sepTheory

   Defines two separating conjunctions STAR and BIGSTAR over sets.

 set_sepLib

   Provides simpsets sep_ss and sep2_ss that simplifies expressions 
   containing STAR. Also provides conversions, rules and tactics 
   for rearranging terms containing STAR.

 progTheory

   Defines high-level Hoare-triples for reasoning about machine-code.
   The main definitions are RUN, GPROG, PROG and PROC.

 arm_progTheory

   Specialises progTheory to Anthony Fox's model of the ARM processor. 
   The specialisaation is done via a translation function arm2set. 
   The theory defines ARM_RUN, ARM_GPROG, ARM_PROG and ARN_PROC. 
   A handy theorem: ARM_PROG_INTRO1.

 arm_instTheory

   Provides ARM_PROG specifications for most ARM instructions.

 examplesTheory

   Proves a few example implementations. 
   Currently: FAC, GCD and SUM_BTREE.
