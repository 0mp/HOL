This directory (hol/examples/cmos) contains the specification and verification
of some CMOS adders.

The file mk_adders.ml verifies two combinational adders:

   1. An adder from Inder Dhingra that uses bidirectional transistors.

   2. An adder from page 92 of "Introduction to MOS LSI Design" by
      Mavor, Jack and Denyer. This circuit (with some bits missing) also
      occurrs in "Let's Design CMOS Circuits! (Part 1)" by M. Annaratone,
      CMU-CS-84-101.

These adders are verified using a switch model of transistors.

The file mk_cmos.ml creates the theory cmos.th which contains a model of cmos
primitives for dynamic circuits (i.e. ones that use charge storage on isolated
nodes). This model is used to verify a dynamic adder from "CMOS Design
Techniques to Eliminate the Stuck-open Fault Problem of Testability" by A. F.
Murray in "Electronics letters" Vol. 20, No. 19 (13 Sept. 1984).

The file mk_INV.ml creates the theory INV.th in which the inverting buffers
used in the dynamic adder are specified.

The file mk_DYN_ADD.ml creates the theory DYN_ADD.th in which the dynamic
adder is specified and verified.

The file mk_XOR.ml creates a theory XOR.th in which the difference model of
transistors is set up and then used to distinguish the good and bad XOR
circuits described in "Hardware Verification using Higher-Order Logic"
(Camilleri, Gordon and Melham, Technical Report 91).
