This directory contains ports of old examples. The main focus is
on ports of Mike Gordon et al's old hardware formalisation work.

As of April 2018, some HOL88 sources (themselves partly ports of earlier
work were available at http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/tmp/examples.zip. These
files can be found in subdirectory "hol88". The directory "port" contains
ports to the current HOL system, which try to preserve as much of the original
structure as possible. In contrast "port-full" contains port that use modern
library theories and proof-tools.
