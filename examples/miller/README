This example is a verification of the Miller-Rabin probabilistic
primality test incorporating version 2 of probability theory and some
cute example probabilistic programs.

The reason I haven't incorporated it into src/ is that it takes about
2 hours to build, and carries a lot of `baggage' from my experiments
with proof tools.

The most convenient way to build it is change to the examples/miller/
directory, and use the `m' bash script (it also understands `m clean'
to clean the directories). If this doesn't work, or you can't do this,
then there's a longer version:

cd ho_prover
Holmake --qof
cd ../subtypes
Holmake -I ../ho_prover --qof
cd ../RSA
Holmake --qof
cd ../formalize
Holmake -I ../ho_prover -I ../subtypes -I ../RSA --qof
cd ../prob
Holmake -I ../ho_prover -I ../subtypes -I ../RSA -I ../formalize --qof
cd ../groups
Holmake -I ../ho_prover -I ../subtypes -I ../RSA -I ../formalize --qof
cd ../miller
Holmake -I ../ho_prover -I ../subtypes -I ../RSA -I ../formalize -I ../prob -I ../groups --qof
cd ..

It does build RIGHT NOW, but is quite sensitive to changes in the HOL
proof tools. I'll try and support it (especially if anyone uses it),
but sadly it might become more trouble than it's worth.
