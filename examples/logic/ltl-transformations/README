Currently, there are 3 different formalisation of LTL shipped with HOL 4.
There are

- "src/temporal/"
  contains a shallow embedding of LTL. There are both past and future operators.

- "examples/temporal_deep"
  contains a deep embedding of LTL. It was developed by the same group
  as "src/temporal" and has therefore many similarities. The main difference
  is that one is a deep and the other a shallow embedding.

- "examples/logic/ltl"
  contains a deep embedding of LTL. In contrast to "examples/temporal_deep"
  only future operators are present.

The logics are all similar, but tailored towards there concrete usage.
The formalisation of the logics themselves is tiny compared with their usages.
Therefore using one common foundation is not necessarily sensible. As a tiny
nod in this direction, this directory contains translations between these different formalisations.
