Below are instructions for the experiments accompanying the paper
Tree Neural Networks in HOL4.
The implementation of Tree Neural Networks (TNN) can be found under the src/AI/machine_learning directory.

First, install PolyML and install HOL (see HOL/INSTALL file).
Then in the examples/TNN_tasks directory (this directory), 
run the following commands:
- Holmake
