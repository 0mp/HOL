dBScript.sml : develops a theory of (untyped) de-Bruijn terms.

ncScript.sml : builds a theory of name-carrying terms, where terms are
               identified up to alpha-conversion.  This development
               underlies the paper

                "5 Axioms of Alpha Conversion",
                 Andy Gordon and Tom Melham,
                 Proceedings of TPHOLs'96, Springer LNCS 1125.

The remaining files underly the development described in

                 Gordon-Melham axioms"

ncLib.{sig,sml} :
               some simple tools for doing proofs with name-carrying
               syntax.

chap2Script.sml :
               mechanisation of chapter 2 of Hankin's "Lambda calculi:
               a guide for computer scientists"

chap3Script.sml :
               mechanisation of most of chapter 3 of Hankin

labelledTermsScript.sml :
               mechanisation of section 11.1 from Barendregt's "The
               lambda calculus: its syntax and semantics"

term_posnsScript.sml :
               establishes a type for labelling reductions

finite_developmentsScript.sml :
               Barendregt's proof of the finite-ness of developments
               (section 11.2), mechanising this notion as well as that
               of residuals.

standardisationScript.sml
               Barendregt's proof of the standardisation theorem, from
               section 11.4.
