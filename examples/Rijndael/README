A purely functional, and somewhat naive, implementation and proof of
correctness of the AES (also known as "Rijndael") algorithm from Rijmen  
and Daemen. The AES homepage is

    http://csrc.nist.gov/encryption/aes/

Unlike most implementations, no arrays or vectors are used in our
code. The main datastructure operated on is the `state', which is a 4x4
block of bytes (8 bit words). We model it by a 16-tuple of bytes. 

The dependencies are:

         |
      RoundOpTheory  (basic operations that happen during a round)
         |
         |
      aesTheory      (defn of rounds, key schedule, AES, correctness)
         |
         |
      modesTheory    (modes of operation, padding, correctness of CBC_AES)
