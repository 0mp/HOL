Directory structure:

- semantics
    The definition on MiniML, including
    - its abstract syntax
    - small step semantics
    - big step semantics
    - a type system
    - a printer for MiniML's AST.
    The definition is expressed in Lem (http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~so294/lem),
    but might not work on the released version at any given time, so the 
    generated HOL is also included.

- metatheory
    Proofs about MiniML, including
    - type soundness
    - determinism
    - equivalence of the big and small step semantics

- hol2miniml
    A proof-producing translator from HOL functions to MiniML

- hol2miniml/okasaki-examples
    15 data structures/algorithms from Chris Okasaki's Purely Functional Data
    Structures

- compiler
    The sketchy beginnings of a verified compiler from MiniML to ???
