We have decided not to translate include-book forms from ACL2 to HOL;
they are simply dropped.  But for a robust infrastructure, we should
guarantee that for a given set of ACL2 books, then those and all
included sub-books, and no more, are translated to HOL.  As of August
19, 2010, we do not yet have not implemented any mechanical check that
provides such a guarantee.
