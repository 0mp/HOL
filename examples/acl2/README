The files here are part of joint project between Mike Gordon
(University of Cambridge) and Warren Hunt and Matt Kaufmann
(University of Texas) to develop a logically sound and robust link
between the HOL4 and ACL2 proof tools.

This is work in progress. For further details see:

 http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/mjcg/hol2acl2/

The directories here are:

ml ............................ ML and HOL files
lisp .......................... Lisp and ACL2 files
examples ...................... Examples
tests ......................... Regression tests

To use these tools, edit the following file to give correct paths:

  .acl2holrc.bash

You don't have to do anything further with this file, as it is
automatically "source"d in the top-level test script, tests/doit.
However, you may wish to execute

  source .acl2holrc.bash

in your bash shell, in case you are using tools in any way other than
through tests/doit.
