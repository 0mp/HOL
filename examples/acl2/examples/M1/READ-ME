Overview
--------

This directory is a preliminary slurping in of J's M1 model into HOL.

Holmake should perform the complete proof, including rebuilding the
HOL-ACL2 infrastructure. This will takes tens of minutes.

There is quite a bit of messy and ad hoc code that must be tidied up.
In particular, for some reason I don't understand, M1Script.sml
(renamed M1Script.sml.fails in this directory) doesn't work: it
complains that it can't find the standard libraries; I am using
make_M1Theory.ml instead (see Holmakefile).

There is a rather arbitrary division of HOL functions operating on
s-expressions into those that are defined properly in HOL (using
acl2Define) and those that are axiomatically defined based on trusting
ACL2 (these are defined with acl2AxiomDefine). Ideally everything
should be properly defined, but I was too lazy to figure out the
termination proofs for ACL2::NONNEGATIVE-INTEGER-QUOTIENT and
COMMON-LISP::EXPT (see file hol_defaxiomsScript.sml).

To get a flavour of M1 in HOL, run hol in this directory and then
evaluate:

 load "M1Theory";
 open M1Theory;

For more details evaluate:

 load "load_book";
 val M1_thms = map (I ## load_book.load_simp_fn) (theorems "imported_acl2");

A log of doing this is in the file M1_thms.txt.

Notes:

 1. the HOL functions corresponding to the AC2 M1 model are in
    imported_acl2Theory;

 2. the function load_simp_fn performs some simplifications.
