Overview
--------

This directory is a preliminary slurping in of J's M1 model into HOL
tweaked manually to try to get it to build in HOL4 under Moscow ML and
Poly/ML.

Holmake should perform the complete proof, including rebuilding the
HOL-ACL2 infrastructure. This will takes tens of minutes.

There is a rather arbitrary division of HOL functions operating on
s-expressions into those that are defined properly in HOL (using
acl2Define) and those that are axiomatically defined based on trusting
ACL2 (these are defined with acl2AxiomDefine). Ideally everything
should be properly defined, but I was too lazy to figure out the
termination proofs for ACL2::NONNEGATIVE-INTEGER-QUOTIENT and
COMMON-LISP::EXPT (see file hol_defaxiomsScript.sml).

To get a flavour of M1 in HOL, run hol in this directory, load
"M1Examples" and then look at M1Examples.Examples1 (selectged
examples) and M1Examples.Examples2 (ev erything).

A log of doing this is in the file M1Examples.txt.

Notes:

 1. The HOL functions corresponding to the AC2 M1 model are in
    imported_acl2Theory;

 2. The ML function acl2_simp performs some simplifications on
    imported ACL2.

 3. The ACL2 name "!" (i.e. factorial) is translated to "exclaim" in HOL.
