Evaluating the ARM models.

When using HOL interactively in this directory use:

$ hol -I ..

The files are as follows:  

 * Data.sml, Lexer.sml, Parser.sml: A parser for ARM instructions.

 * arm_evalScript.sml: An ARM ISA model that is more suited to symbolic
     simulation.  (There are no hardware interrupts and a "perfect" memory
     model is implemented.)

 * instructionScript.sml: Defines a HOL datatype for ARM instructions.

 * instructionSyntax.sml: Syntactic support the ARM datatype.  The parser
     is used to build terms.  (Also provides pretty-printing and instruction
     encoding.)

 * modelsLib.sml: compsets for evaluation of the models (ISA and ARM6)
     with CBV_CONV.

 * bsubstScript.sml: introduces a block substitution operation ``::-``, which
    provides an efficient way to represent the state of the main memory.

 * simScript.sml, arm_evalLib.sml: Theorems and ML hooks for evaluation.

 * run_arm_evalLib.sml: Some examples of running the ISA model.

 * gui/: A sml_tk front-end - not currently being maintained.
