This directory contains a correctness proof for a variant of the ARM6
microprocessor design.

The files are as follows:  

 * armScript.sml: A HOL specification of the ARM instruction set.  This is
    loosely based on Dominic Pajak's ML specification done at Leeds.

 * coreScript.sml: A HOL specification of the ARM6 micro-architecture.
    This is based on Daniel Schostak's specification done at Leeds. 

 * onestepScript.sml and io_onestepScript.sml: A framework for carrying out
    processor verifications.

 * compLib.sml and lemmasLib.sml: Tactics and simpsets used in the verification.

 * my_listScript.sml, lemmasScript.sml, blockScript.sml,
   interruptsScript.sml and memoryScript.sml:
     Various lemmas to the main correctness result. 

 * correctScript.sml:  The proof of correctness.

 * armLib.sml, coreLib.sml, simScript.sml, patriciaLib.sml, testScript.sml: 
    Initial work on executing the models.


TODO:

 * Currently working on (symbolic) execution with a simple GUI front end.

 * Should change ISA to make sure it only accepts interrupts when the I and F
   masks are not set (masked).  This requires an initialisation function an
   the ISA level and would require some further verification work.
