This directory contains a HOL proof of correctness for a microprocessor
design closely based on the ARM6.  The files are as follows:  

armScript.sml: A HOL specification of the ARM instruction set.  This is
loosely based on Dominic Pajak's ML specification done at Leeds.  For a
detailed description of the HOL specification read
www.cl.cam.ac.uk/TechReports/UCAM-CL-TR-545.pdf

coreScript.sml: A HOL specification of the ARM6 micro-architecture.
This is based on Daniel Schostak's specification done at Leeds. 

onestepScript.sml: Provides a framework for carrying out processor
verifications.  This is described in
www.cl.cam.ac.uk/TechReports/UCAM-CL-TR-512.pdf

lemmasScript.sml and lemmasLib.sml: Lots of lemmas to the main
correctness results. 

correctScript.sml:  The main proof of correctness.
