The following is a brief listing of what's available in the distribution:

-   LambekScript.sml: Basic definitions and theorems of Lambek Calculus

-   CutFreeScript.sml: Properties of “cut-free” sequent proofs

-   ExampleScript.sml: Some examples

Project paper is on arXiv: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07318](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07318)
