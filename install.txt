Getting and Building the HOL system
-----------------------------------

Get the HOL sources by WWW from

     http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/HVG/FTP/

or from SourceForge (links to which are on the page above).

You will also need the Moscow ML compiler (version 2.00) from

     http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~sestoft/mosml.html

First, however, please read the rest of these instructions carefully.

Windows users can also build the system by running a self-installing
executable (available from the above places).  To do this,

   1.  Ensure that Moscow ML is installed first
   2.  Run the executable and follow the on-screen instructions.

The instructions that follow are how to build from sources, on any of
the supported operating systems


Building the HOL system.
--------------------------

A. First, install Moscow ML. This is usually straightforward. The
   directory where it lives will be called <mosml-dir> in the following.

   * If you intend to use ML embeddings of C libraries, like the
     HolBdd library, you are so far restricted to running on Linux,
     Solaris, and other Unix implementations. You will probably have
     to build MoscowML from *source* in order to dynamically load C
     libraries, as is required by, e.g., HolBddLib. In this case, you
     will have to set a few shell variables; this is explained in the
     MoscowML installation directions.

     The upshot: if you are working on a Unix system, you should build
     MoscowML from source, making the necessary tweaks that enable
     dynamic linking.  It's possible that the Moscow ML .rpm file will
     work; the "binary distribution" is known not to.

   * If you are running on Windows, you must set the PATH and MOSMLLIB
     environment variables as described in the installation
     instructions for Moscow ML.  Windows won't find the MoscowML DLL
     without the appropriate entry in PATH, and Moscow ML won't run
     without knowing where its library is.


B. Unpack HOL with the commands

       gunzip release.tar.gz; tar xf release.tar

   in Unix, or the appropriate clicking activity in Windows NT (use a
   program like Winzip). The resulting directory will be called
   <hol-dir> in the following.  When fully built, <hol-dir> takes
   approximately 35M of disk space, so be sure you have enough before
   starting.


C. Enter the "tools" directory and type

       mosml < smart-configure.sml

                    ------------------------------

   This should guess some configuration options, and then build some
   of HOL's support tools.  If this appears to work correctly, proceed
   to step D below.

   If smart-configure guesses the options incorrectly, then you will
   need to provide them yourself. Do this by creating a file called

     config-override

   in <hol-dir>.  In this file provide ML bindings for as  many of the
   values that were incorrectly guessed by smart-configure.sml.  For
   example, if the holdir guess was incorrect, then put

     val holdir = "a full pathname to my holdir"

   for example. The OS, holdir and mosmldir parameters must be given
   as ML strings, while dynlib_available must be an ML boolean (either
   true or false).

   The valid values for OS are "linux", "unix", "solaris", "macosx"
   and "winNT".  If you are on a unix operating system that is not
   Linux or Solaris, it is OK to just put "unix"; however, this will
   imply that the robdd library will not be usable (it currently only
   builds on linux and solaris).  "winNT" stands in for all versions
   of "Windows NT", "Windows 2000", and (we believe) "Windows XP".

   It's possible that in order to get the muddy library to build, you
   will need to change the binding for GNUMAKE, which is made in the
   tools/configure.sml file.  Edit this file if necessary to change
   this binding to whatever's required:

           val GNUMAKE = "gnumake";

   If you are building HOL on an OS that is *not* Solaris or Linux,
   the muddy library is not currently accessible. In such a case, the
   value of GNUMAKE does not matter.

D. Now perform the following shell command:

       <hol-dir>/bin/build

   This builds the system. In case of difficulty, the configuration
   can be gone through by hand, by starting <mosmldir>/bin/mosml and
   stepping through tools/configure.sml.  Similarly, the execution of
   build.sml can also be stepped through in MoscowML. This can be
   somewhat time-consuming, but will help pinpoint any problems.

   The build program ends up creating two copies of every ML object
   file.  To save space on Unix, use the -symlink option.  This option
   is not available on Windows, unfortunately.  To save space there,
   you can use the -small option, but this has the disadvantage of
   forcing any subsequent builds to rebuild everything, regardless of
   where changes might have occurred.

E. If bin/build completes, successfully, you are done. From <hol-dir>
   you can now access

      bin/hol              * The standard HOL interactive system;
      bin/hol.unquote      * The interactive system with quote preprocessing;
      bin/hol.bare         * A "stripped down" version of hol
      bin/hol.bare.unquote * A "stripped down" version of hol.unquote
      bin/Holmake          * A batch compiler for HOL directories;
      src/                 * System sources;
      Manual/              * User manuals for the system;
      examples/            * Examples of the use of the system.


External tools.
----------------

The HOL installation currently includes a C library (in HolBddLib) and
the C sources for the SMV model-checker (in temporalLib). Both of these
require a C compiler to have been specified in tools/configure.sml.

Loading the BDD libraries muddyLib or HolBddLib will fail unless
MoscowML has been built with dynamic linking enabled.


Dealing with failure.
---------------------

   * Send a message to hol-support@cl.cam.ac.uk giving a full transcript of
     the failed installation. Also make sure that you include the
     following details:

           . hardware/OS the build failed on
           . version of MoscowML being used
           . version of HOL being built

   * Alternatively, use the Support tracker web-page at

       http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=31790&atid=403398

     and submit a request for support.  You can also use the Bugs
     forum on SourceForge.

   * If a build attempt fails for some reason, you should attempt to invoke

        bin/build -cleanAll

     before a new build attempt.
