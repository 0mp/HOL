HOLyHammer is a machine learning for theorem proving framework.

Requires:

* OCaml >= 3.12
    sudo apt-get install ocaml 
* g++ >= 4.8 (recent version with C++11 support)  
    Ubuntu 12.04:
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test -y
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install g++-4.8

Install holyhammer: (done during the build)
 
  run Holmake in src/holyhammer
  run Holmake in src/holyhammer/hh/hh1
  run Holmake in src/holyhammer/hh
  run Holmake in src/holyhammer/predict
  run Holmake in src/holyhammer/predict/mepo

Provers: Eprover(1.8 1.9 2.0), Z3 (4.0)
  
  Binaries with the appropriate version should be copied or linked 
  in the directory src/holyhammer/provers. 
  Make sure you have the permission to execute them.
  Their names should respectively be eprover and z3.

  Eprover 2.0 : http://wwwlehre.dhbw-stuttgart.de/~sschulz/E/E.html.
  Z3 4.0 (not 4.4.0): http://isabelle.in.tum.de/components/ .
  
Predictors:

  The two best predictors are KNN and Mepo. The default predictor is KNN. 
  - Mepo works best when your conjecture has rare symbols.
  - KNN learns from previous proofs.
   
Example: 

  load "holyHammer";
  open holyHammer;
  hh [] ``1 + 1 = 2``;
  METIS_PROVE lemmas ``1 + 1 = 2``;
