HOLyHammer is a machine learning for theorem proving framework.

Usage (requires at least one installed external prover):
  load "holyHammer"; open holyHammer;
  holyhammer ``1+1=2``;

Install external provers:
  1) Download provers
  - Eprover 2.0 (latest version should work too):
      Source: http://wwwlehre.dhbw-stuttgart.de/~sschulz/E/E.html
      Installing Eprover produces the binary file PROVER/eprover.
  - Z3 4.0 (only):
      Linux binary: http://isabelle.in.tum.de/components/
  - Vampire 4.2.2 (latest version should work too):
      Linux binary: https://vprover.github.io/download.html
      Source: https://github.com/vprover/vampire
      Installing Vampire produces the binary file "vampire_rel_master_3993" 
      in the top directory.
  2) Prover binaries should be copied or linked in 
     the directory src/holyhammer/provers.
     They should be respectively renamed to eprover, z3 and vampire.
  3) Make sure you have the permission to execute them (chmod +x)
