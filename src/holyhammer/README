HOLyHammer is a machine learning for theorem proving framework.

Requires:

* OCaml >= 3.12
    sudo apt-get install ocaml 
* g++ >= 4.8 (recent version with C++11 support)  
    Ubuntu 12.04:
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test -y
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install g++-4.8

Install holyhammer: (done during the build)
 
  run Holmake in src/holyhammer
  run Holmake in src/holyhammer/hh/hh1
  run Holmake in src/holyhammer/hh
  run Holmake in src/holyhammer/predict
  run Holmake in src/holyhammer/predict/mepo

Supported provers: Eprover, Z3 and (Vampire) 
  
  They need to be installed manually so that they be called from the command 
line using the respective commands eprover, vampire and z3. 
  At least one of these provers
should be installed for holyHammer to work.

  Eprover: 
    Tested with 1.8 and 1.9. Can be fetched from 
    http://wwwlehre.dhbw-stuttgart.de/~sschulz/E/E.html.
  Vampire: 
    Tested with version 2.6. Parsing may need changing for higher versions.
    Waiting for 3.0 to be released at http://www.vprover.org/download.cgi
    before adapting the parsing.
  Z3: 
    Tested with 4.0. The newest version of z3 does not support 
    tptp input. Can be fetch from http://isabelle.in.tum.de/components/.
  CVC4: 
    Waiting for a good minimization algorithm to be implemented
    as it does not output have unsatisfiable cores.
  
Predictors:

  The two best predictors are KNN and Mepo. The default predictor is KNN. 
  - Mepo works best when your conjecture has rare symbols.
  - KNN learns from previous proofs.
  - Kepo is a combination of the previous two.
  They have different strength so please switch between predictors:
  - "set_predictors KNN;"
  - "set_predictors Mepo;" 
  - "set_predictors Kepo;"
  Alternatively, you can call hh_try which tries all of them sequentially.
   
Example: 

  load "holyHammer";
  open holyHammer;
  hh [] ``1 + 1 = 2``;
  METIS_PROVE lemmas ``1 + 1 = 2``;
