(*
semantics of names:
Assumption (SOME s)
  - must be an assumption
  - must be the same as any other assumptions called s
  - must be different from any other assumptions not called s
Assumption NONE
  - must be an assumption
Conclusion
  - must be the conclusion
Anything
  (no constraints)
*)

(*
semantics of whole term boolean:
  - if true then the match must be of the whole assumption/conclusion
  - otherwise, match any subterm (i.e., like Coq's context patterns)
*)

(*
semantics of pattern variables:
  2 kinds of variable:
  - free variable in goal
  - unification variable
      - by convention, must end, and not start, with an underscore
  assume all free variables cannot be mistaken for unification variables
    (if attempting to bind a non-unification variable, the match will fail)
*)

(*
semantics of matcher list with a tactic (match_case):
Iterate over matchers, all must match:
1. Parse quotation in context of goal (and check no free vars ending with _)
2. Attempt to match the appropriate part of the goal with the pattern (keep track which match)
   - if failed, backtrack within current matcher;
   - if no assumptions match, backtrack to previous matcher
3. Go to the next matcher
4. When all matchers are done:
   - Introduce abbreviations for all unification variables
   - Try running the tactic
     - if it fails: undo abbreviations, backtrack
     - if it succeeds: undo abbreviations, done

semantics of (matcher list * thms_tactic) list:
Iterate over list, taking first thing that works.
