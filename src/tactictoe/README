TacticToe is a tactic-based prover.

It explores proof trees by repeatly selecting tactics that are
appropriate to solve the current goal.
The selection is performed on a dataset of recorded human tactics.

USAGE: See examples/ttt_demoScript.sml.

EVALUATION:
  load "tacticToe";
  open tacticToe;
  load "yourTheory";
  ttt_record (); (* takes a while *)
  ttt_eval_thy "your";

  Evaluates how much tactictoe can automatically re-prove 
  from previous definitions.
  The result is stored in src/tactictoe/search_log/proof/your. 

ISSUES:
  Applying numSimps.clear_arith_caches is necessary in rare circumstances.

NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS:
