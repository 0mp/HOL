TacticToe is a tactic-based prover.

It explores proof trees by repeatly selecting tactics that are
appropriate to solve the current goal.
The selection is performed on a dataset of recorded human tactics.

RECORDING: 
  Because of some issue, you sometimes need to restart "hol" after recording.
  
  load "tacticToe"; open tacticToe;
  load "yourTheory";
  ttt_record (); 
    (* takes a long time (4-8h) if you have many ancestors to yourTheory *)
  
FAST RECORDING: 
  It is an instant way to test tactictoe for theories of the standard library.
  Disclaimer: pre-recored data may get outdated and 
  some recorded tactics may become unusable after some time.
  1) Download pre-recorded standard HOL4 library:
    wget -O ttt_data.tar.gz "http://www.thibaultgauthier.fr/ttt_data_2018_04_11.tar.gz"
  2) Extract ttt_data.tar.gz and 
     move the 3 folders in ttt_data to HOL/src/tactictoe
  3) In the end, you should have the directories:
    HOL/src/tactictoe/fea_theorem
    HOL/src/tactictoe/fea_tactic
    HOL/src/tactictoe/fea_goallist (this directory is empty for now)
  4) Apply the RECORDING step.
  
USAGE: (after RECORDING) 
  load "tacticToe"; open tacticToe;
  tactictoe ``1+1=2``;
  
  See more examples in examples/ttt_demoScript.sml.

EVALUATION of a theory (after RECORDING):
  Evaluates how much tactictoe can automatically re-prove 
  from previous theorems
  The result is stored in src/tactictoe/search_log/proof/your.

  load "tacticToe"; open tacticToe;
  load "yourTheory";
  ttt_eval_thy "your";

NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS:
  Keep up-to-date: infix tokens in hhsInfix.sml, polyml values in hhsUnfold.sml.
  Issue: 1) Arith.clean cache 2) Logging directories missing causes error when fast recording.
