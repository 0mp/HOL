TacticToe is a tactic-based prover.

It searches for a proof by repeatedly applying suitable tactics for each goal state that it produces. 

RECORDING: 
  
  load "tttUnfold"; open tttUnfold;
  load "fooTheory";
  ttt_record (); (* takes a long time (2-12h) *)
  
FAST RECORDING (alternative): 
  It is an instant way to test tactictoe for theories of the standard library.
  Disclaimer: pre-recored data may get outdated (i.e. 
  some recorded tactics may become unusable after some time).
  1) Download pre-recorded standard HOL4 library:
    wget -O ttt_data.tar.gz "http://www.thibaultgauthier.fr/ttt_data_2018_04_11.tar.gz"
  2) Extract ttt_tacticdata.tar.gz to create src/tactictoe/ttt_tacticdata
  3) Apply the RECORDING step.
  
USAGE: (after RECORDING) 
  load "tacticToe"; open tacticToe;
  tactictoe ``1+1=2``;
  
  See more examples in examples/ttt_demoScript.sml.

EVALUATION of a theory (after RECORDING): To appear.

NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS:
  Keep up-to-date: 
    infix tokens in hhsInfix.sml, polyml values in tttUnfold.sml.
  Issue: 
   1) Arith.clean cache: not sure if fixed yet or not.
   2) (Metis/or some other mechanism) seems to remembers when it is terminated, 
      so the subsequent call with the same input may not work:
      fixed by raising the tactic timeout from 2.0 to 20.0 seconds.
