TacticToe is a tactic-based prover.

It searches for a proof by repeatedly applying suitable tactics for each goal state that it produces. 

RECORDING:
  load "tttUnfold"; open tttUnfold;
  load "fooTheory";
  ttt_record (); (* takes a long time (2-12h) *)

USAGE: (after RECORDING) 
  load "tacticToe"; open tacticToe;
  tactictoe ``1+1=2``;

CLEANING: 
  - TacticToe calls depends on the data stored in 
    src/tactictoe/ttt_tacdata 
  - TacticToe recording/evaluation depends on data stored in 
    src/AI/sml_inspection/open
  Please remove these directories and start afresh after updating HOL 
  (usually necessary).
