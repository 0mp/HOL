TacticToe is a tactic-based prover.

It explores proof trees by repeatly selecting tactics that are
appropriate to solve the current goal.
The selection is performed on a dataset of recorded human tactics.

USAGE: See examples/ttt_demoScript.sml.

EVALUATION of a theory (not needed to use TacticToe):
  Evaluates how much tactictoe can automatically re-prove 
  from previous definitions.
  The result is stored in src/tactictoe/search_log/proof/your.

  load "tacticToe";
  open tacticToe;
  load "yourTheory";
  ttt_record (); (* takes a while *)
  ttt_eval_thy "your";
  
  Warnings: 
    if you do interrupt evaluation, 
    please run ttt_record_thy "your" as evaluation messes up with the database.
    For the same reason, do not run evaluation in two theories in parallel
    unless the two theories are independent from each other.

ISSUES:
  Applying numSimps.clear_arith_caches is necessary in rare circumstances.
