TacTicToe is a tactic-based prover.

It explores a proof trees by repeatly selecting tactics that are
appropriate to solve the current goal.
The selection relies on a machine learning algorithm on a data set of recorded human tactics in previous proofs.

Run in HOL:
  load "tactictoe"; 
  open tactictoe;
  tactictoe ``1+1=2``;
