TacticToe is a tactic-based prover.

It searches for a proof by repeatedly applying suitable tactics for each goal state that it produces. 

RECORDING: 
  Because of some issue, you sometimes need to restart "hol" after recording.
  
  load "tacticToe"; open tacticToe;
  load "yourTheory";
  ttt_record (); 
    (* takes a long time (4-8h) if you have many ancestors to yourTheory *)
  
FAST RECORDING (alternative): 
  It is an instant way to test tactictoe for theories of the standard library.
  Disclaimer: pre-recored data may get outdated (i.e. 
  some recorded tactics may become unusable after some time).
  1) Download pre-recorded standard HOL4 library:
    wget -O ttt_data.tar.gz "http://www.thibaultgauthier.fr/ttt_data_2018_04_11.tar.gz"
  2) Extract ttt_tacticdata.tar.gz to create src/tactictoe/ttt_tacticdata
  3) Apply the RECORDING step.
  
USAGE: (after RECORDING) 
  load "tacticToe"; open tacticToe;
  tactictoe ``1+1=2``;
  
  See more examples in examples/ttt_demoScript.sml.

EVALUATION of a theory (after RECORDING):
  Evaluates how much tactictoe can automatically re-prove 
  from previous theorems
  
  load "tacticToe"; open tacticToe;
  load "fooTheory";
  ttt_eval_thy "foo";

  The result is stored in src/tactictoe/search_log/proof/foo.
