Installation
============

In normal circumstances, all you have to do is 

   1. Enter the "src" directory and type "Holmake"
   2. Enter the smv.2.4.3 directory and type "make"

The first command will build the HOL theories and conversions of the
"temporal" library. The second will build the SMV executable.  You
moreover have to set up the variables "temporalLib.smv_path" and
"temporalLib.smv_call" before using the conversions. (These are found in
src/temporalLib.sml.)  The first one contains the path where the
executable file of the smv system is located, and the second contains a
call with suitable parameters.  

The library can be accessed simply by invoking 

   load "temporalLib";

in a Hol98 session. Some examples of usage of the library are in the
file "examples.sml".
