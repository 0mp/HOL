VER 1.1 (april 1998)
--------------------
  +  Added bdd_varprofile
  +  Added fdd_scanset
  +  Mucho better documentation.
  +  Added Henrik Reif Andersen's BDD notes to the documentation.
  +  Added BDD_REORDER_RANDOM for test purposes (usefull for others?)
  x  Fixed a bug in bdd_appex and bdd_appall.
  x  Fixed a bug in bdd_simplify.
  x  Speed fixup to fdd_extdomain 
  x  Lots of small (insignificant?) bug fixes in fdd.c.
  x  bdd_load/save updated to take reordering into account.
  x  Generalized bdd_restrict to use a BDD variable set.
  x  Fixed the identifiers for the operator caches.
  x  The math functions log1p and pow2 has been removed as they didn't
     exist on some systems. The same applies to M_LN2.
  x  New file structure and makefiles.
  -  Removed bdd_break, bdd_restart1


VER 1.2 (june 1998)
-------------------
  +  Added support for dynamic variable reordering
  +  Added reordering handler (bdd_reorder_hook)
  +  More added to the docs
  x  Changed the event handlers (bdd_xxx_hook)


VER 1.3 (june 1998)
-------------------
  x  Fixed a few serious bugs in the reordering code


VER 1.4 (july 1998)
-------------------
  The package just got a name: BuDDy

  +  Added functions bdd_var, bdd_low, bdd_high.
  +  Added technical documentation in docs/tech.txt
  x  Overloaded C++ functions are not used any more. This mainly changes
     the name of the printing functions in C++.
  x  Changed datatype names (You'll hate me for this one):
        BddPair -> bddPair
	BddStat -> bddStat
	BddGbcStat -> bddGbcStat
  x  Added slightly more documentation.
  x  Some internal changes to the code - should not be visible to users.

  +  Added fdd_domain
  x  Fixed a bug in bdd_setvarnum and bdd_extvarnum.
  x  Fixed a bug in bdd_newpair() which would give problems with reordering.
  x  Speedup changes in bdd_exist, bdd_forall, bdd_appex, bdd_appall
  x  Speedup changes in bdd_restrict
  x  Changed bdd_gbc_hook to include both pre and post garbage collection.
