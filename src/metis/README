   [Metis]
     * The Metis library is released with [1]HOL 4.
     * It is an automatic prover for HOL subgoals.

Quick Guide to Using the Metis Library

   At the top of your proof script, write

     load "metisLib";
     open metisLib;

   Opening the Metis library makes available the automatic provers

       METIS_TAC : thm list -> tactic
     METIS_PROVE : thm list -> term -> thm

   which both take a list of theorems that are used to prove the goal.

Examples

   prove (``?x. x``, METIS_TAC []);

   prove (``!x. ~(x = 0) ==> ?!y. x = SUC y``,
          METIS_TAC [numTheory.INV_SUC, arithmeticTheory.num_CASES]);

   METIS_PROVE [prim_recTheory.LESS_SUC_REFL, arithmeticTheory.num_CASES]
   ``(!P. (!n. (!m. m < n ==> P m) ==> P n) ==> !n. P n) ==>
     !P. P 0 /\ (!n. P n ==> P (SUC n)) ==> !n. P n``;

How It Works

   This is how METIS_TAC proves a HOL goal:

    1. First  some  HOL  conversions  and  tactics  simplify the goal and
       convert it to conjunctive normal form.
    2. The normalized problem is converted to first-order syntax.
    3. Resolution  and  model  elimination provers attack the first-order
       problem, hopefully deriving a refutation.
    4. The  first-order  refutation  is  lifted  to  a  HOL  proof of the
       original goal.

Comparison with MESON_TAC

   METIS_TAC  is  generally slower than MESON_TAC on simple problems, but
   has better coverage. For example, MESON_TAC cannot prove the following
   goals:

     METIS_PROVE [] ``?x. x``;
     METIS_PROVE [] ``p (\x. x) /\ q ==> q /\ p (\y. y)``;

   The  combination  of  model  elimination  and  resolution  calculi  in
   METIS_TAC  allows  some  hard goals to be proved that are too deep for
   the  HOL  version of MESON_TAC, such as the GILMORE_9 and STEAM_ROLLER
   problems.  Also,  the  ordered  paramodulation  used by the resolution
   component of METIS_TAC allows it to prove harder equality problems. An
   example to illustrate this is the goal

     METIS_PROVE []
     ``(!x y. x * y = y * x) /\ (!x y z. x * y * z = x * (y * z)) ==>
      a * b * c * d * e * f = f * e * d * c * b * a``;

Known Bugs

   METIS_TAC   combines  resolution  and  model  elimination  calculi  by
   time-slicing between them, so in principle it could successfully prove
   a goal on one occasion but diverge on another. However, this situation
   isn't likely to arise in practice.

   Using resolution as a solver is incomplete when equality is present.

History and Credit

   This library was written by Joe Hurd, with the intention of evolving a
   replacement  to  John  Harrison's  MESON_TAC that is commonly used for
   first-order proof in HOL.

   The  model  elimination and resolution calculi were based on MESON_TAC
   and John Harrison's forthcoming book about theorem proving.

   A  large  collection  of  HOL subgoals are [2]available in first-order
   format.

Etymology

   Metis  is  the  innermost  moon of Jupiter, lying within the planetary
   ring. The picture above is of the moon Metis, and comes from [3]NASA.

   Metis is a consort of Zeus in [4]Greek mythology:

     "Zeus  has a fling with Metis, cunning wisdom, technical craft, and
     then eats her so that she can't produce a rival child. The child is
     instead born from Zeus's head as Athena."

   The [5]Metis [6]people of Canada are

     "mixed-blood  offspring  of  French fur traders from the North West
     Company  or  Scottish and English fur traders from the Hudson's Bay
     Company and Cree, Ojibway or Saulteaux women ... As people of mixed
     ancestry  increased  in number and married amongst themselves, they
     developed  a new culture, neither European nor Indian, but a fusion
     of the two and a new identity as Metis."

Change Log

  Version 1.3: 17 June 2002

   Goals submitted to MESON_TAC when HOL is built .......... 1953
   Proved by MESON_TAC ..................................... 1953
   Proved by METIS_TAC within 10s .......................... 1946

  Between Versions 1.2 and 1.3

     * Implemention  of  definitional  CNF to reduce blow-up in number of
       clauses (usually caused by nested boolean equivalences).
     * Resolution  is  more  robust and efficient, and includes an option
       (off by default) for clauses to inherit ordering constraints.

  Version 1.2: 19 November 2002

   Goals submitted to MESON_TAC when HOL is built .......... 1779
   Proved by MESON_TAC ..................................... 1779
   Proved by METIS_TAC within 10s .......................... 1774

  Between Versions 1.1 and 1.2

     * Ground-up  reimplementation  of the resolution calculus, which now
       performs ordered resolution and ordered paramodulation.
     * A  single  entry-point  METIS_TAC, which uses heuristics to decide
       whether to apply FO_METIS_TAC or HO_METIS_TAC.
     * {HO|FO}_METIS_TAC  both  initially  operate  in typeless mode, and
       automatically try again with types if an error occurs during proof
       translation.
     * Extensionality axiom now included in HO_METIS_TAC by default.

  Version 1.1: 21 September 2002

   Goals submitted to MESON_TAC when HOL is built .......... 1745
   Proved by MESON_TAC ..................................... 1745
   Proved by FO_METIS_TAC within 10s ....................... 1485
   Proved by HO_METIS_TAC within 10s ....................... 1698
   Proved by one of {FO|HO}_METIS_TAC within 10s ........... 1717

  Between Versions 1.0 and 1.1

     * Added  a  "metis"  entry  to  the HOL trace system: it nows prints
       status information during proof (if HOL is in interactive mode).
     * Restricted   (universal   and  existential)  quantifiers  are  now
       normalized by the NNF conversion.
     * Improved performance in the model elimination proof procedure with
       better caching (following a suggestion from John Harrison).
     * First-order substitutions are now fully Boultonized.
     * The  first-order  logical  kernel automatically performs peep-hole
       optimizations to keep proofs as small as possible.

  Version 1.0: 18 July 2002
