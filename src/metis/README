   [Metis]
     * The Metis library is released with [1]HOL 4.
     * It provides an interface between HOL and first-order logic, and
       tools for proving (and solving) first-order goals.

Quick Guide to Using the Metis Library

   At the top of your proof script, write

     load "metisLib";
     open metisLib;

   Then you can use

        METIS_TAC  to prove first-order goals; and
     HO_METIS_TAC  to prove (some) higher-order goals.

   Both  of  these tactics take a list of theorems that are used to prove
   the goal.

Inside the Metis Library

   The Metis tactics prove a HOL goal hol_goal as follows:

    1. HOL  tactics  simplify  hol_goal and convert it to CNF. [folTools,
       normalForms]
    2. A first-order goal fol_goal is derived from hol_goal. [folMapping]
    3. First-order  calculi attack fol_goal, hopefully deriving a theorem
       fol_th. [mlibMetis]
    4. A  logical  kernel  keeps  track of the proof of every first-order
       theorem that is derived. [mlibKernel]
    5. The  proof of fol_th is translated to HOL, producing a HOL theorem
       hol_th. [folMapping]
    6. hol_th is used to prove the original HOL goal hol_goal. [folTools]

Comparison with MESON_TAC

   The Metis provers are generally slower than MESON_TAC, but have better
   coverage. For example, MESON_TAC cannot prove the following two goals:

     METIS_PROVE [] ``p (\x. x) /\ q ==> q /\ p (\y. y)``;
     METIS_PROVE [] ``?x. x``;

   The  combination  of  model  elimination  and  resolution  calculi  in
   HO_METIS_TAC allows some hard goals to be proved that are too deep for
   the  HOL  version of MESON_TAC, such as the GILMORE_9 and STEAM_ROLLER
   problems.

   The  Metis  library provides an interface to tools that solve goals as
   well as prove them, including the user-friendly

     metisLib.PROLOG_SOLVE : thm list -> Query -> Result stream

   MESON_TAC automatically spots higher-order goals and sets up the proof
   translation  accordingly, but in the Metis library you have to do this
   manually by selecting either METIS_TAC or HO_METIS_TAC.

Known Bugs

   The  resolution component in HO_METIS_TAC occasionally goes completely
   haywire and eats all the memory :-(

   HO_METIS_TAC  combines  resolution  and  model  elimination calculi by
   time-slicing between them, so in principle it could successfully prove
   a goal on one occasion but diverge on another. However, this situation
   isn't likely to arise in practice.

History and Credit

   This library was written by Joe Hurd, with the intention of evolving a
   replacement  to  John  Harrison's  MESON_TAC that is commonly used for
   first-order proof in HOL.

   The  model  elimination  and  resolution calculi were based on code in
   mesonLib and John Harrison's forthcoming book about theorem proving.

   A collection of HOL goals that could be successfully proved by a Metis
   prover are [2]available in first-order format.

Etymology

   Metis  is  the  innermost  moon of Jupiter, lying within the planetary
   ring. The picture above is of the moon Metis, and comes from [3]NASA.

   Metis is a consort of Zeus in [4]Greek mythology:

     "Zeus  has a fling with Metis, cunning wisdom, technical craft, and
     then eats her so that she can't produce a rival child. The child is
     instead born from Zeus's head as Athena."

   The [5]Metis people of Canada are

     "mixed-blood  offspring  of  French fur traders from the North West
     Company  or  Scottish and English fur traders from the Hudson's Bay
     Company and Cree, Ojibway or Saulteaux women ... As people of mixed
     ancestry  increased  in number and married amongst themselves, they
     developed  a new culture, neither European nor Indian, but a fusion
     of the two and a new identity as Metis."

Change Log

  Version 1.1: 21 September 2002

   Goals submitted to MESON_TAC when HOL is built ............. 1745
   Proved by MESON_TAC ........................................ 1745
   Provable by METIS_TAC within 10s ........................... 1485
   Provable by HO_METIS_TAC within 10s ........................ 1698
   Provable by one of METIS_TAC and HO_METIS_TAC within 10s ... 1717

  Between Versions 1.0 and 1.1

     * Added  a  "metis"  entry  to  the HOL trace system: it nows prints
       status information during proof (if HOL is in interactive mode).
     * Restricted   (universal   and  existential)  quantifiers  are  now
       normalized by the NNF conversion.
     * (First-order) METIS_TAC can now handle boolean variables.
     * Improved  performance in the model elimination proof procedure due
       to better caching (following a suggestion from John Harrison).
     * First-order substitutions are now fully Boultonized.
     * The  first-order  logical kernel makes local tweaks to keep proofs
       as small as possible.

  Version 1.0: 18 July 2002
