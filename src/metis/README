   [Metis]
     * The Metis library is released with [1]HOL 4.
     * It  provides  an  interface between HOL and first-order logic, and
       tools for proving (and solving) first-order goals.

Quick Guide to Using the Metis Library

   At the top of your proof script, write

     open metisLib;

   Then you can use

        METIS_TAC  to prove first-order goals; and
     HO_METIS_TAC  to prove (some) higher-order goals.

   Both  of  these tactics take a list of theorems that are used to prove
   the goal.

Inside the Metis Library

   The *METIS_TAC tactics prove a HOL goal hol_goal as follows:

    1. HOL  tactics  simplify  hol_goal and convert it to CNF. [folTools,
       normalForms]
    2. A first-order goal fol_goal is derived from hol_goal. [folMapping]
    3. First-order  calculi attack fol_goal, hopefully deriving a theorem
       fol_th. [mlibMetis]
    4. A  logical  kernel  keeps  track of the proof of every first-order
       theorem that is derived. [mlibKernel]
    5. The  proof of fol_th is translated to HOL, producing a HOL theorem
       hol_th. [folMapping]
    6. hol_th is used to prove the original HOL goal hol_goal. [folTools]

Comparison with MESON_TAC

   The Metis library has better treatment of boolean variables and lambda
   terms. For example, MESON_TAC cannot prove the following two goals:

     metisLib.METIS_PROVE [] ``p (\x. x) /\ q ==> q /\ p (\y. y)``;
     metisLib.HO_METIS_PROVE [] ``?x. x``;

   The  combination  of  model  elimination  and  resolution  calculi  in
   HO_METIS_TAC allows some hard goals to be proved that are too deep for
   MESON_TAC, such as the GILMORE_9 and STEAM_ROLLER problems.

   The  Metis  library provides an interface to tools that solve goals as
   well as prove them, including the user-friendly

     metisLib.PROLOG_SOLVE : thm list -> Query -> Result stream

   MESON_TAC automatically spots higher-order goals and sets up the proof
   translation  accordingly, but in the Metis library you have to do this
   manually by selecting either METIS_TAC or HO_METIS_TAC.

   When HOL is built, 1435 goals are submitted to MESON_TAC.

     MESON_TAC ....................... proves 1435
     METIS_TAC ....................... proves 1240 within 10 seconds
     HO_METIS_TAC .................... proves 1346 within 10 seconds
     One of METIS_TAC and HO_METIS_TAC proves 1389 within 10 seconds

   MESON_TAC  is  typically faster on these goals than both METIS_TAC and
   HO_METIS_TAC.  The  HOL  goals  that could be successfully proved by a
   Metis prover are available in first-order format at

Known Bugs

   The  resolution component in HO_METIS_TAC occasionally goes completely
   haywire and eats all the memory :-(

   HO_METIS_TAC  combines  resolution  and  model  elimination calculi by
   time-slicing between them, so in principle it could successfully prove
   a  goal  on one occasion but diverge on another. In practice, however,
   this situation isn't likely to arise.

History and Credit

   This library was written by Joe Hurd, with the intention of evolving a
   replacement  to  John  Harrison's  MESON_TAC that is commonly used for
   first-order proof in HOL.

   The  model  elimination  and  resolution calculi were based on code in
   mesonLib and John Harrison's forthcoming book about theorem proving.

   Release 1.0 was integrated into the HOL sources on 18 July 2002.

Etymology

   Metis  is  the  innermost  moon of Jupiter, lying within the planetary
   ring. The picture above is the moon Metis, and comes from [3]NASA.

   Metis is a consort of Zeus in [4]Greek mythology:

     "Zeus  has a fling with Metis, cunning wisdom, technical craft, and
     then eats her so that she can't produce a rival child. The child is
     instead born from Zeus's head as Athena."

   The [5]Metis people of Canada are

     "mixed-blood  offspring  of  French fur traders from the North West
     Company  or  Scottish and English fur traders from the Hudson's Bay
     Company and Cree, Ojibway or Saulteaux women ... As people of mixed
     ancestry  increased  in number and married amongst themselves, they
     developed  a new culture, neither European nor Indian, but a fusion
     of the two and a new identity as Metis."

   METIS_TAC  seemed  like  a  better name for the successor of MESON_TAC
   than MEGRANDSON_TAC :-)
