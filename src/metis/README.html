<h2>Quick Guide to Using the Metis Library</h2>

At the top of your proof script, write

<p>

<kbd>&nbsp open metisLib;</kbd>

<p>

Then you can use

<p>

<kbd>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp METIS_TAC&nbsp</kbd> to prove first-order goals; and <br>
<kbd>&nbsp HO_METIS_TAC&nbsp</kbd> to prove (some) higher-order goals.

<p>

Both of these tactics take a list of theorems that are used to prove
the goal.


<h2>Inside the Metis Library</h2>

The <kbd>*METIS_TAC</kbd> tactics prove a HOL goal <kbd>hol_goal</kbd>
as follows:

<p>

<ol>
<li>HOL tactics simplify <kbd>hol_goal</kbd> and convert it to CNF. [<em>folTools, normalForms</em>]</li>

<li>A first-order goal <kbd>fol_goal</kbd> is derived from
<kbd>hol_goal</kbd>. [<em>folMapping</em>]</li>

<li>First-order calculi attack <kbd>fol_goal</kbd>, hopefully deriving
a theorem <kbd>fol_th</kbd>. [<em>mlibMetis</em>]</li>

<li>A logical kernel keeps track of the proof of every first-order
theorem that is derived. [<em>mlibKernel</em>]</li>

<li>The proof of <kbd>fol_th</kbd> is translated to HOL, producing a
HOL theorem <kbd>hol_th</kbd>. [<em>folMapping</em>]</li>

<li><kbd>hol_th</kbd> is used to prove the original HOL goal
<kbd>hol_goal</kbd>. [<em>folTools</em>]</li>
</ol>


<h2>Comparison with <kbd>MESON_TAC</kbd></h2>

The Metis library has better treatment of boolean variables and lambda
terms. For example, <kbd>MESON_TAC</kbd> cannot prove the following
two goals:

<p>

<kbd>&nbsp metisLib.METIS_PROVE    [] ``p (\x. x) /\ q ==> q /\ p (\y. y)``;</kbd><br>
<kbd>&nbsp metisLib.HO_METIS_PROVE [] ``?x. x``;</kbd>

<p>

The combination of model elimination and resolution calculi in
<kbd>HO_METIS_TAC</kbd> allows some hard goals to be proved that are
too deep for <kbd>MESON_TAC</kbd>, such as the <kbd>GILMORE_9</kbd>
and <kbd>STEAM_ROLLER</kbd> problems.

<p>


The Metis library provides an interface to tools that solve goals as
well as prove them, including the user-friendly

<p>

<kbd>&nbsp metisLib.PROLOG_SOLVE : thm list -> Query -> Result stream</kbd>

<p>

<kbd>MESON_TAC</kbd> automatically spots higher-order goals and sets
up the proof translation accordingly, but in the Metis library you
have to do this manually by selecting either <kbd>METIS_TAC</kbd> or
<kbd>HO_METIS_TAC</kbd>.

<p>

When HOL is built, 1435 goals are submitted to <kbd>MESON_TAC</kbd>.

<p>

<kbd>&nbsp MESON_TAC ....................... proves 1435</kbd><br>

<kbd>&nbsp METIS_TAC ....................... proves 1240 within 10 seconds</kbd><br>

<kbd>&nbsp HO_METIS_TAC .................... proves 1346 within 10 seconds</kbd><br>

<kbd>&nbsp One of METIS_TAC and HO_METIS_TAC proves 1389 within 10 seconds</kbd>

<p>

<kbd>MESON_TAC</kbd> is typically faster on these goals than both
<kbd>METIS_TAC</kbd> and <kbd>HO_METIS_TAC</kbd>. The HOL goals that
could be successfully proved by a Metis prover are available in
first-order format at

<p>

<kbd>&nbsp <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jeh1004/research/problems/hol.sml.gz">

<h2>Known Bugs</h2>

The resolution component in <kbd>HO_METIS_TAC</kbd> occasionally goes
completely haywire and eats all the memory <kbd>:-(</kbd>

<p>

<kbd>HO_METIS_TAC</kbd> combines resolution and model elimination
calculi by time-slicing between them, so in principle it could
successfully prove a goal on one occasion but diverge on another. In
practice, however, this situation isn't likely to arise.

<h2>History and Credit</h2>

This library was written by Joe Hurd, with the intention of evolving a
replacement to John Harrison's <kbd>MESON_TAC</kbd> that is commonly
used for first-order proof in HOL.

<p>

The model elimination and resolution calculi were based on code in
<kbd>mesonLib</kbd> and John Harrison's forthcoming book about theorem
proving.

<p>

Release 1.0 was integrated into the HOL sources on 18 July 2002.


<h2>Etymology</h2>

Metis is the innermost moon of Jupiter, lying within the planetary
ring. The picture above is the moon Metis, and comes from <a
href="http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/amalthea.html#metisx">NASA</a>.

<p>

Metis is a consort of Zeus in <a href="http://www.stir.ac.uk/Departments/Arts/ReligiousStudies/rlists/7212/7212-11.html">Greek mythology</a>:

<blockquote>
 "Zeus has a fling with Metis, cunning wisdom, technical craft, and
  then eats her so that she can't produce a rival child. The child is
  instead born from Zeus's head as Athena."
</blockquote>

<p>

The <a href="http://www.turtle-island.com/metis.html">Metis people</a>
of Canada are

<blockquote>
 "mixed-blood offspring of French fur traders from the North West Company
  or Scottish and English fur traders from the Hudson's Bay Company and
  Cree, Ojibway or Saulteaux women ... As people of mixed ancestry
  increased in number and married amongst themselves, they developed a
  new culture, neither European nor Indian, but a fusion of the two
  and a new identity as Metis."
</blockquote>

<p>

<kbd>METIS_TAC</kbd> seemed like a better name for the successor of
<kbd>MESON_TAC</kbd> than <kbd>MEGRANDSON_TAC</kbd> <kbd>:-)</kbd>
