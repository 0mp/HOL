<h2>Quick Guide to Using the Metis Library</h2>

At the top of your proof script, write

<p>

<kbd>&nbsp load "metisLib";</kbd><br>
<kbd>&nbsp open metisLib;</kbd>

<p>

Opening the Metis library makes available the automatic provers

<p>

<kbd>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp METIS_TAC : thm list -> tactic</kbd><br>
<kbd>&nbsp METIS_PROVE : thm list -> term -> thm</kbd>

<p>

which both take a list of theorems that are used to prove the goal.


<h2>Examples</h2>

<kbd>prove (``?x. x``, METIS_TAC []);</kbd>

<p>

<kbd>prove (``!x. ~(x = 0) ==> ?!y. x = SUC y``,<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp METIS_TAC [numTheory.INV_SUC, arithmeticTheory.num_CASES]);</kbd>

<p>

<kbd>METIS_PROVE [prim_recTheory.LESS_SUC_REFL, arithmeticTheory.num_CASES]<br>
``(!P. (!n. (!m. m < n ==> P m) ==> P n) ==> !n. P n) ==><br>
&nbsp !P. P 0 /\ (!n. P n ==> P (SUC n)) ==> !n. P n``;</kbd>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

This is how <kbd>METIS_TAC</kbd> proves a HOL goal:

<p>

<ol>
<li>First some HOL conversions and tactics simplify the goal and
convert it to conjunctive normal form.</li>

<li>The normalized problem is converted to first-order syntax.</li>

<li>Resolution and model elimination provers attack the first-order
problem, hopefully deriving a refutation.</li>

<li>The first-order refutation is lifted to a HOL proof of the
original goal.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Comparison with <kbd>MESON_TAC</kbd></h2>

<kbd>METIS_TAC</kbd> is generally slower than <kbd>MESON_TAC</kbd> on
simple problems, but has better coverage. For example,
<kbd>MESON_TAC</kbd> cannot prove the following goals:

<p>

<kbd>&nbsp METIS_PROVE [] ``?x. x``;</kbd><br>
<kbd>&nbsp METIS_PROVE [] ``p (\x. x) /\ q ==> q /\ p (\y. y)``;</kbd>

<p>

The combination of model elimination and resolution calculi in
<kbd>METIS_TAC</kbd> allows some hard goals to be proved that are too
deep for the HOL version of <kbd>MESON_TAC</kbd>, such as the
<kbd>GILMORE_9</kbd> and <kbd>STEAM_ROLLER</kbd> problems. Also, the
ordered paramodulation used by the resolution component of
<kbd>METIS_TAC</kbd> allows it to prove harder equality problems. An
example to illustrate this is the goal

<p>

<kbd>&nbsp METIS_PROVE []<br>
&nbsp ``(!x y. x * y = y * x) /\ (!x y z. x * y * z = x * (y * z)) ==><br>
&nbsp&nbsp  a * b * c * d * e * f = f * e * d * c * b * a``;</kbd>


<h2>Known Bugs</h2>

<kbd>METIS_TAC</kbd> combines resolution and model elimination calculi
by time-slicing between them, so in principle it could successfully
prove a goal on one occasion but diverge on another. However, this
situation isn't likely to arise in practice.

<p>

Using resolution as a solver is incomplete when equality is present.


<h2>History and Credit</h2>

This library was written by Joe Hurd, with the intention of evolving a
replacement to John Harrison's <kbd>MESON_TAC</kbd> that is commonly
used for first-order proof in HOL.

<p>

The model elimination and resolution calculi were based on
<kbd>MESON_TAC</kbd> and John Harrison's forthcoming book about
theorem proving.

<p>

A large collection of HOL subgoals are <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jeh1004/research/problems">available in
first-order format</a>.


<h2>Etymology</h2>

Metis is the innermost moon of Jupiter, lying within the planetary
ring. The picture above is of the moon Metis, and comes from <a
href="http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/amalthea.html#metisx">NASA</a>.

<p>

Metis is a consort of Zeus in <a href="http://www.stir.ac.uk/Departments/Arts/ReligiousStudies/rlists/7212/7212-11.html">Greek mythology</a>:

<blockquote>
 "Zeus has a fling with Metis, cunning wisdom, technical craft, and
  then eats her so that she can't produce a rival child. The child is
  instead born from Zeus's head as Athena."
</blockquote>

<p>

The <a href="http://www.turtle-island.com/metis.html">Metis people</a>
of Canada are

<blockquote>
 "mixed-blood offspring of French fur traders from the North West Company
  or Scottish and English fur traders from the Hudson's Bay Company and
  Cree, Ojibway or Saulteaux women ... As people of mixed ancestry
  increased in number and married amongst themselves, they developed a
  new culture, neither European nor Indian, but a fusion of the two
  and a new identity as Metis."
</blockquote>


<h2>Change Log</h2>

<h3>Version 1.2: 19 November 2002</h3>

<kbd>Goals submitted to MESON_TAC when HOL is built .......... 1779</kbd><br>
<kbd>Proved by MESON_TAC ..................................... 1779</kbd><br>
<kbd>Proved by METIS_TAC within 10s .......................... 1774</kbd><br>

<h3>Between Versions 1.1 and 1.2</h3>

<ul>

<li>Ground-up reimplementation of the resolution calculus, which now
performs ordered resolution and ordered paramodulation.</li>

<li>A single entry-point <kbd>METIS_TAC</kbd>, which uses heuristics
to decide whether to apply <kbd>FO_METIS_TAC</kbd> or
<kbd>HO_METIS_TAC</kbd>.</li>

<li><kbd>{HO|FO}_METIS_TAC</kbd> both initially operate in typeless
mode, and automatically try again with types if an error occurs during
proof translation.</li>

<li>Extensionality axiom now included in <kbd>HO_METIS_TAC</kbd> by
default.</li>

</ul>

<p>

<h3>Version 1.1: 21 September 2002</h3>

<h3>Between Versions 1.0 and 1.1</h3>

<ul>

<li>Added a <kbd>"metis"</kbd> entry to the HOL trace system: it nows
prints status information during proof (if HOL is in interactive
mode).</li>

<li>Restricted (universal and existential) quantifiers are now
normalized by the NNF conversion.</li>

<li>Improved performance in the model elimination proof procedure due
to better caching (following a suggestion from John Harrison).</li>

<li>First-order substitutions are now fully Boultonized.</li>

<li>The first-order logical kernel makes local tweaks to keep proofs
as small as possible.</li>
