x  means bugfix or changed code
-  means removed code

Thanks to the following people for bug reports and suggestions
  Gerd Behrmann
  Henrik Reif Andersen
  Ken Larsen
  Nikolaj Bjorner
  Jacob Lichtenberg


VER 1.1 (april 1998)
--------------------
  +  Added bdd_varprofile
  +  Added fdd_scanset
  +  Mucho better documentation.
  +  Added Henrik Reif Andersen's BDD notes to the documentation.
  +  Added BDD_REORDER_RANDOM for test purposes (usefull for others?)
  x  Fixed a bug in bdd_appex and bdd_appall.
  x  Fixed a bug in bdd_simplify.
  x  Speed fixup to fdd_extdomain 
  x  Lots of small (insignificant?) bug fixes in fdd.c.
  x  bdd_load/save updated to take reordering into account.
  x  Generalized bdd_restrict to use a BDD variable set.
  x  Fixed the identifiers for the operator caches.
  x  The math functions log1p and pow2 has been removed as they didn't
     exist on some systems. The same applies to M_LN2.
  x  New file structure and makefiles.
  -  Removed bdd_break, bdd_restart1


VER 1.2 (june 1998)
-------------------
  +  Added support for dynamic variable reordering
  +  Added reordering handler (bdd_reorder_hook)
  +  More added to the docs
  x  Changed the event handlers (bdd_xxx_hook)


VER 1.3 (june 1998)
-------------------
  x  Fixed a few serious bugs in the reordering code


VER 1.4 (july 1998)
-------------------
  The package just got a name: BuDDy
  +  Added functions bdd_compose, bdd_veccompose, bdd_ite.
  +  Added functions bdd_setbddpair, bdd_setbddpairs.
  +  Added functions bdd_var, bdd_low, bdd_high.
  +  Added technical documentation in docs/tech.txt
  x  Overloaded C++ functions are not used any more. This mainly changes
     the name of the printing functions in C++.
  x  Changed datatype names (You'll hate me for this one):
        BddPair -> bddPair
	BddStat -> bddStat
	BddGbcStat -> bddGbcStat
  x  Added slightly more documentation.
  x  Some internal changes to the code - should not be visible to users.


VER 1.5 (september 1998)
------------------------
  +  Added bdd_cofactor
  +  Added and fixed some error checks in fdd.c
  x  Fixed a bug in bdd_setvarnum().


VER 1.6 (november 1998)
-----------------------
  +  Added bdd_resetpair
  +  Added bdd_satcountset, bdd_satcountlnset
  +  Added macro bdd_relprod
  +  Added fdd_overlapdomain
  +  Added fdd_domain
  x  Fixed a bug in bdd_setvarnum and bdd_extvarnum.
  x  Fixed a bug in bdd_newpair() which would give problems with reordering.
  x  Speedup changes in bdd_exist, bdd_forall, bdd_appex, bdd_appall
  x  Speedup changes in bdd_restrict
  x  Changed bdd_gbc_hook to include both pre and post garbage collection.


VER 1.7 (september 1999)
------------------------
  +  Added support for boolean vector operations used in integer arithmetics
  +  Split "bdd.h" into "bdd.h", "fdd.h" and "bvec.h"
  +  Added bdd_cachestats
  +  Added bdd_and, bdd_or, bdd_xor, bdd_impl, bdd_biimpl
     (wrappers for bdd_apply).
  +  Added a BDD calculator for combinatorial circuits as an example.
  +  Added an example showing the use of the FDD interface.
  +  Added bdd_autoreorder_times, bdd_getreorder_method, bdd_getreorder_times,
     bdd_reorder_probe, bdd_enable_reorder, bdd_disable_reorder,
     bdd_var2level, bdd_level2var, bdd_reorder_gain, bdd_swapvar
  +  Added bdd_file_hook, bdd_strm_hook, fdd_file_hook, fdd_strm_hook
  +  Added support for dynamic resizing of the operator caches with
     the function bdd_setcacheratio.
  +  Added more documentation.
  x  Bugfix in reordering code. This would appear when recursive variable
     blocks were defined (blocks with sub-blocks).
  x  Speedup changes in the variable reordering code
  x  The automatic reordering threshhold function has been changed
  x  Automatic reordering is now interrupting and restarts bdd operations
  x  Prototype for bdd_reorder_hook changed.
  x  Printing of reorder information (verbose level > 0) is changed.
  x  The threshold for stopping of the iterative reordering methods has
     been changed. The reordering now continues until no progress is done
     at all (before it would stop when less than 5% where gained).
  x Added a few sanity checks to many of the functions.
  x Bugfix (parameter checking) in fdd_ithvar.
  - bdd_varlevel removed (use bdd_var2level and bdd_level2var).
