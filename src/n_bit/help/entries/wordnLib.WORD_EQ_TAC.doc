\DOC WORD_EQ_TAC

\TYPE {WORD_EQ_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Proves equality of boolean word expressions.

\DESCRIBE
When {WORD_EQ_TAC} is applied to a goal of the form
{
   !w1 ... xn. M = N
}
where {M} and {N} are built from the word operations
{AND}, {OR}, {EOR}, and {NOT}, it attempts to decide the
equality, failing if {M} and {N} are not able to be proven
equal by using simple algebra.

\EXAMPLE
An application of {WORD_EQ_TAC} solves the goal
{
?- !w1 w2. NOT(w1 & w2) = NOT(w1) | NOT(w2)
}
quickly:
{
- e WORD_EQ_TAC;
OK..
> val it =
    Initial goal proved.
    |- !w1 w2. NOT (w1 & w2) = NOT w1 | NOT w2 : goalstack
}
