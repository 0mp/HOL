If the last time you merged changes to the HOL trunk into HOL-Omega
was 5651, and the current version of the main HOL trunk is 5659:

(Use Query > Log to find out the last merged version, and the current
version of the HOL trunk is visible in RapidSVN.
Or in a shell type "svn update" to find out the current main HOL version.)

Make sure each working copy is updated;

In RapidSVN, select Repository > Merge; brings up a dialog box. Fill in:

First working copy or URL:                             Revision
http://hol.svn.sf.net/svnroot/hol/HOL                  5651

Second working copy or URL:                            Revision
http://hol.svn.sf.net/svnroot/hol/HOL                  5659

Destination path:
/usr/local/hol/hol-omega

Don't use https.

With the "Recursive" button checked, but the "Force" button not checked,

Press "OK".

This should copy the independent changes on the trunk into the HOL-Omega
branch.

!!! These should be checked; and any conflicts resolved.

Then when it is fine, check it into the SourceForge repository for
HOL-Omega:

svn status
< should show the modified files >

IMPORTANT! Must give the REVISION NUMBERS in the message!!!

svn commit -m "ported revisions 5651:5659 from HOL to HOL-Omega"

If things go wrong, you can recover to the current state of the systems
by typing in a shell in the main hol-omega directory

svn revert -R .
